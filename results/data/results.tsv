94935558	Indeed the Law Commission Working Paper No 77 , Implied Terms in Contracts for the Supply of Goods ( 1977 ) , recognised three possible approaches : firstly , the bailor is strictly liable ( Jones v Page ( 1867 ) 15 LT 619 per Kelly CB at p621 ) ; secondly , the goods must be as fit as care and skill can make them ( Hyman v Nye ( 1881 ) 6 QBD 685 per Lindley J at p682 ) ; thirdly , the bailor is liable only if he fails to take reasonable care to ensure that the goods are fit which , as the via media of the two other approaches , was eventually adopted in s9 of SGSA 1982 .	the goods are fit	goods	fit
60016972	You 're only entitled to money back if the goods are faulty in some way .	the goods are faulty	goods	faulty
94865392	Thus instead of writing If the Seller shall have given the Buyer notice that the goods are ready for collection , and the Buyer shall fail to collect them within seven days from service of such notice , the Seller shall be entitled to make arrangements for the storage of the goods and the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller all costs and charges incurred as a result of such storage the drafter could write If after the Seller has given the Buyer notice that the goods are ready for collection , the Buyer fails to collect the goods within seven days , the Seller may make arrangements for the storage of the goods and the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller all costs and charges incurred as a result of such storage .	the goods are ready	goods	ready
94865322	Thus instead of writing If the Seller shall have given the Buyer notice that the goods are ready for collection , and the Buyer shall fail to collect them within seven days from service of such notice , the Seller shall be entitled to make arrangements for the storage of the goods and the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller all costs and charges incurred as a result of such storage the drafter could write If after the Seller has given the Buyer notice that the goods are ready for collection , the Buyer fails to collect the goods within seven days , the Seller may make arrangements for the storage of the goods and the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller all costs and charges incurred as a result of such storage .	the goods are ready	goods	ready
94865731	A better version would therefore read : If the Seller gives the Buyer notice that the goods are ready for collection but the Buyer fails to collect the goods within seven days of service of that notice , the following provisions shall apply : ( a ) the Seller may make arrangements for the storage of the goods until they are collected and ( b ) the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller all costs and charges incurred in connection with the storage of the goods .	the goods are ready	goods	ready
94853000	Obviously this is only a general rule : in particular , where the goods are complicated , or where the normal course of dealing would so indicate , it may be relatively easy to establish that the parties did not intend their agreement to become binding until other details were finalised ; this issue is examined further in Chapter 4 , 6 below .	the goods are complicated	goods	complicated
94933711	This phenomenon can also be seen in trading stamp transactions so that s4(1) of the Trading Stamps Act 1964 ( substituted by s16(1) of SOGIT 1973 ) provides : In every redemption of trading stamps for goods , notwithstanding any term to the contrary on which the redemption is made , there is --- ( a ) an implied warranty on the part of the promoter of the trading scheme that he has a right to give the goods in exchange ; ( b ) an implied warranty that the goods are free from any charge or encumbrance not disclosed or known to the person obtaining the goods before , or at the time of redemption and that that person will enjoy quiet possession of the goods except so far as it may be disturbed by the owner or other person entitled to the benefit of any charge or encumbrance so disclosed or known ; ( c ) an implied warranty that the goods are of merchantable quality , except that there is no such warranty ( i ) as regards defects specifically drawn to the attention of the person obtaining the goods before or at the time of redemption ; or ( ii ) if that person examines the goods before or at the time of redemption , as regards defects which that examination ought to reveal .	the goods are free	goods	free

94947199	The trader has the right to make representations that the goods are safe and to have the notice revoked .	the goods are safe	goods	safe
94865599	This structure is followed in the example given above and can be broken down as follows : If after the Seller has given the Buyer notice that the goods are ready for collection [ case ] , the Buyer fails to collect the goods within seven days [ condition ] , the Seller [ subject ] may make arrangements for the storage of the goods [ action ] and the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller all costs and charges incurred as a result of such storage .	the goods are ready	goods	ready
94328583	If the Seller shall be unable , through circumstances beyond its control ( including without limitation lack of shipping instructions from the Purchaser ) , to deliver the goods within 14 days after notification to the Purchaser or its agent that the goods are ready for delivery , the Seller shall be entitled to arrange storage on behalf of the Purchaser , whereupon delivery shall be deemed to have taken place , all risk in the goods shall pass to the Purchaser , and delivery to the Purchaser of the relevant warehouse receipt shall be deemed to be delivery of the goods for the purposes of Condition 4 .	the goods are ready	goods	ready
60023013	But if the goods are faulty you 'd have the right to decline the credit note and ask for money back .	the goods are faulty	goods	faulty
60022926	But that brings us back to the point we were stressing a moment ago , if the goods are faulty you 're entitled to money back , a cash refund .	the goods are faulty	goods	faulty
77723069	This question will be important if Z wishes to sue his seller for breach of contract ( e.g. if the goods are defective ) or if Z fails to pay the price .	the goods are defective	goods	defective

46350420	Under the Consumer Credit Act , items costing more than £100 are protected if the supplier fails to deliver or the goods are faulty .	the goods are faulty	goods	faulty

24780890	The Sale of Goods Act 1979 only gives you an entitlement to money back if the goods are faulty , misdescribed or not fit for the purpose you requested them to perform .	the goods are faulty	goods	faulty
60021972	You should always be entitled to a refund provided the goods are faulty .	the goods are faulty	goods	faulty
94892919	Thus , for instance , a clause which provides that a seller gives no undertaking that the goods are fit for any purpose and purports to exclude the implied term in s14(3) of the SGA 1979 , or a term which disclaims any duty of care in negligence , is subject to the Act .	the goods are fit	goods	fit
