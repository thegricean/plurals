 73030854:  <The actions are subject> to random error terms each period , which are normal , independent and identically distributed through time with distributions and respectively .

 37898517:  If <the adventurers are successful> in picking the lock , this trap wo n't be activated , but they will have to be very careful taking out the money without breaking the glass sphere ( no test needed , but you should roll dice as if you were making some secret test just to scare the players ) .
 62786359:  The individualised young men and women in <the advertisements are single> , and hence available , but could be any class , even classless .

 19650959:  And <the agents are likely> to rebel against time-wasting vetting every time they go to work .

103870237:  So , if erm so your , your , your principal complaint , I maybe wrong it maybe not your principal , look at page a hundred and twenty seven for your assistance , erm standard form of agreements restricted competitions , the service of the petitions or the agents provided so this is names and thereby restrict the competition as the agents them say erm then impose on [unclear] that it was a regime etcetera , erm that the , the competitive the anti competitive one is your sub paragraph one is n't it ? , on page one , two , seven your saying look here is a [gap:name] of , of dictated through their bi-laws , a standard form that all agents must use , [unclear] you say , erm , er that that restricts competition because it means that agents are free , or as free as they ought to be , erm to compete with each other or providing services to outside names , I follow that , I did n't say I except it , but I follow that entirely , erm , but does n't , does n't , if you 're right does n't it follow that <the agreements are void> ?

 52804616:  <The aims are laudable> , given the often grotesque caricatures of African , Asian and Arab histories and cultures ; the neglect of the destructive , exploitative effects of colonialism and imperialism in school texts and in popular cultural forms such as comics , adventure stories , adult fiction and the cinema ; and the absence of any serious treatment of resistance to imperial rule ( Mackenzie , 1984 , 1986 ; Klein , 1985 ) .

   479081:  With an aerotow , if the towplane pilot realises that <the airbrakes are open> , he can signal to the glider pilot by rapid rudder-waggling .
 21236144:  For their part any incomers see themselves as having made considerable sacrifices to come to Shetland , giving up their homes in the south near friends and perhaps relatives , and facing the possibility that while they are away inflation will ensure that they can not afford to buy their old houses back again when they return ( hence the price guarantees that <the airlines are obliged> to offer on their employees ' houses in Shetland ) .

  2968092:  <The alternatives are various> kinds of pretence or self-deception .

 93741155:  It 's difficult as far as <the alternatives are concerned> , is that no alternatives , but effectively it 's about four times the cost to administer , because you can dip a hundred sheep off one of the er , packs and it 's a smaller pack .

 87900496:  While the known antioxidant actions of <the aminolsalicylates are compatible> with the proposal that ROM play a major role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease , proof of the hypothesis must await the outcome of controlled trials in the human disease of more specific agents that interfere with oxidative metabolism .

 48932799:  This may include a statement confirming that <the animals are healthy> and fit to travel and an import licence .
 43313896:  Nor should these statements necessarily be taken literally : <the animals are interesting> and people adopt attitudes to them not because of any beliefs in the direct material effect of squirrels on child-birth but because of their usefulness in helping people to make intellectual and symbolic discriminations --- they are `` good to think '' .
 48927275:  It is important that <the animals are healthy> at the outset and that they remain healthy .
 99572861:  Weight is important ... if <the animals are undersized> , they may not survive the seven month long hibernation period .

 73347821:  On this basis we would assess the impact of , say , a state pension plan in terms of the present value of contributions relative to the present value of pensions over the lifetime , and <the answers are likely> to be considerably different from the pattern of redistribution in terms of current incomes .
 64423554:  If a man has lost his employment and his wife , he has been charged with drunk driving and his blood tests show damaged liver function , one hardly needs to ask questions on his alcohol consumption and <the answers are unlikely> to be fully truthful in any case .

 85118589:  However , we have already pointed out , by implication , one very important syntactic consequence : only the ascriptive adjectives are eligible to appear predicatively , that is , in a position like that of hungry in : ( 19 ) <the antelopes are hungry> As was already indicated in Chapter 1 , and as we shall see in more detail in Chapter 3 , predicative position is the surface structure which expresses the intensional relation of assignment , and assignment does require that the property of the adjective should be construed as applied to the entity of the subject noun phrase .
 49522495:  In the more generalized insects <the antennae are filiform> and many-segmented , the segments being equal or sub-equal in size .
 19691333:  Sitting in the middle of <the antennae are specialised> chlorophyll molecules that trap the photon energy .

 20252928:  <The ants are voracious> predators like the drivers , devastating foresters like the leafcutters , or efficient stockmen like the aphid-tending species .
 92429159:  Surprisingly , Hawaii has plants with extrafloral nectaries , though <no ants are native> there .

 88832310:  <The arguments are similar> to those for rent above .

 70646939:  <The arms are capable> of coiling vertically .
 17507225:  In circumstances such as this the local historian has perhaps two problems : to attempt to find a feudal or familial association or dependency , and , if <the arms are uncoloured> , to ascertain if they are those of le Scot , Ridel , Basset , Wrottesley or Bryan , or , indeed , some other line .

 92560793:  Some of <the arrangements are pure> Walt Disney : Riu riu chiu opens with a wonderful thwanging of superimposed 4ths on massed psalteries , followed by a relatively straightforward rendition of the song itself on panpipes and recorders , variously punctuated by the sound of castanets , triangles and whistles .
 96325942:  February the twenty eighth , end of February , yeah , my Lord so of course erm staying the counterclaim as a set off would n't really progress much further because after eighty five , I mean that 's simply a subsidiary way in which the defence arises , article eighty five arises primarily because we say underlying <the arrangements are void> and you 're enforcing something , which is void and you ca n't do it , that 's not a set off claim , but your Lordship I mean , my Lord that 's why that does n't really get them any further , my Lord they 've always had outstanding , which they 've never pursued er for order fourteen so they can always ti try as they said they will for the other erm , erm preemptive attacks upon us

111035698:  Is that a hot area so far as <the arts are concerned> ?
 71453803:  The APU Working Party rested its case firmly on the philosophical groundwork of Best ( 1980 ) , who over recent years has pioneered the argument that <the arts are amenable> to judgments that are as `` objective '' as those employed in scientific research .
 71433480:  The conclusion to be drawn is that whoever decides funding criteria must believe either that <the arts are irrelevant> , or too low a priority , or that current arts practice is satisfactory ( Arts Education Forum , 1987 ) .
  8516326:  Many examples of ornamentation in <the arts are functional> in this way .
 51857647:  Although he stops short of locating particular disciplines within this typology , one can see that for example the natural sciences would tend to be hard and pure , engineering would be hard and applied , <the arts are likely> to be soft , and so on .
 73838834:  The mountains are no great height , but <the ascents are steep> , the country wild , and the snakes prolific --- all plus factors as far as my father was concerned .

 47229010:  Severe administrative obstacles and problems over valuation of <the assets are prime> obstacles to action .
 52688535:  In the happier situation where <the assets are sufficient> , s. 44(b) provides that debts and liabilities to persons outside the partnership are to be settled first : partners ' loans should then be repaid ; thereafter , partners ' capital contributions and finally any surplus assets should be distributed among the partners in the same proportions as they are entitled to take a share in the profits .
 94130471:  The second and more important reason is to impose liability on the vendor in the event that <the assets are inadequate> or defective or the vendor does not have adequate title .

 96400192:  My Lords whilst thanking the Noble Baroness the Minister for that reply , would she not agree that when they get into hospital the accident case or the emerg emergency case , they 've probably been sent there by a doctor and that there they should th therefore be handled , but what <the associations are concerned> about , particularly the Royal College of Nursing , the B M A and Unison is that emergency and accident cases are put in corridors on trolleys and this ought not to be th a situation which can be tolerated .
 24065331:  The weakness here is not that <the assumptions are incorrect> but that they are incomplete .
 79390548:  This entails study of three approaches to econometric analysis : the `` parametric '' , where relatively strong assumptions are made , and relatively precise conclusions can be drawn ; the `` nonparametric '' , where <the assumptions are vague> and the conclusions imprecise ; and the `` adaptive '' , which falls somewhere in between in respect of the assumptions made , but attempts to rival the parametric approach in the nature of its conclusions .
 85105654:  Even if <the assumptions are unwitting> or unconscious and have been around as long as the scenery , they are still potent .
 79390444:  Generally , the stronger the assumptions upon which the analysis is founded , the more reliable the conclusions reached , if <the assumptions are reasonable> .
 86406407:  An appraisal should answer two key questions what return will be achieved if <the assumptions are correct> ?

 92317828:  <The authorities are able> to influence money supply by the policies examined in Chapter 17 , but also banks and other financial institutions have considerable scope for creating credit in response to demand .
 44775752:  For example , it may be of little value that <the authorities are able> to control interest rates via monetary instruments if the relevant objectives are not very sensitive to changes in interest rates .
 44775883:  But in practice a certain period of time may elapse before <the authorities are able> to recognize that a problem exists .

 57026612:  Although these classifications and their spatial patterns tend to confirm the generally accepted view of rural population already discussed here and in Chapter 4 , Webber and Craig admit that multivariate classification is a subject on which virtually no two practitioners agree either in the UK or in other countries like France ( Chapius , 1973 ) and therefore argue that the crucial test should not be the methodology but whether <the classifications are useful> .
103870266:  My Lord er , can I , there 's , there 's a quali qualified yes to that , yes if on analysis all <the clauses are important> secondary aspects of competition and if so then all of those clauses are void

 67126586:  Where the rocks exposed in <the cliffs are incoherent> , pressures produced by the waves may be of less importance and much of the erosion accomplished by the load flung against the cliffs and by the simple swilling action of the waves , which removes the finer matrix from gravel beds .
  1151707:  There is one section on this face specially for beginners , so although <the climbs are steep> and 4c to 5b they are very well protected .

103477420:  Then the distribution of the number r ab of clones which hybridise to both probes conditional on n ab clones hybridising to either probe is binomial B ( n ab , 1- d ab ) , since <the clones are independent> and the probability that a clone hybridises to both probes given that it hybridises to one is 1- d ab .

 50981542:  The names given to <the clusters are evocative> and largely self-explanatory , but , to give a flavour of the material , here are short pen-portraits of two of them , from rather different parts of the socio-cultural scale :
 39925955:  <The co-managers are Dain> Bosworth Inc and John G Kinnard & Co Inc .
  9840310:  Unlike the big coach operators these are not glorified shopping trips and , because <the coaches are small> ( carrying up to 24 passengers ) , they can reach the places that larger 48-seater coaches ca n't .

 59759990:  He does not quite understand why <the coats are familiar> .
 16325932:  If the White Welsh is crossed to black or red animals and the offspring are also crossed to black or red , the dark extreme of the colour-pointed cline becomes evident and <the coats are colour-sided> or linebacked .
 24239170:  <The codes are unique> and it is extremely unlikely that a `` false '' signal could be given or received .
 59005095:  <The coefficients are likely> to vary even more widely for those regions whose data were not included in the modelling exercise .
 91668270:  Well what 's happening is it the , during the war , right , we 're constraining the computer to estimate , like a single coefficient that is applicable to both war and peacetime er is n't the case , right , th there is a structural change , right , so when th when we constrain the computer to estimate the coefficients throughout the whole period , right , <the coefficients are biased> but if they do n't apply either to the post er pre war peacetime sample neither do they er fit very well to the data during the wartime , right , if we allow the intercept to change but we 're getting much better estimates both wartime and peacetime er parameter 's okay because we have n't got rid of , we 've got rid of that bias , right , in constraining the parameters to fit both wartime and peacetime er time periods .

 28618148:  <The coins are legal> tender but are traded for the value of the precious metal they contain , rather than their nominal face values .
 46247113:  Admittedly , in some of his loving characterisations of English life Orwell almost flew off the edge --- `` the beer is bitterer , <the coins are heavier> , the grass is greener '' --- but even so , the decline of English civility under the impact of `` materialism '' was not only George Orwell 's passion in the interwar years .
 17529902:  <The collections are extensive> .
 90658379:  These are particularly useful when <the collections are subject-specific> .
 78338255:  Does he agree that <the collections are vast> and have often been assembled at very little cost , but at the same time they are the treasures of the night watchmen ?

108355775:  They 've got one in Argos but <the colours are disgusting> and it 's twenty pound , you see I went and brought one for Boo Boo , that one from Argos
 51468667:  Owing to Minton 's technique of holding the design together through the use of a consistent low tone , <the colours are darker> than one would expect and suggest the kind of livid colouring that occurs just before a storm .
 50259419:  In many ways , design is less critical than colour , as the colour of a rug has far more impact on its surroundings ; a discordant pattern will still blend into most rooms , providing <the colours are harmonious> .
111455563:  I think basically , if you 've got good colour sense you 're home and dry as I have said many times , it does n't matter how you put it together , but if <the colours are superb> , it 's going to look good .
 50257712:  If <the colours are lighter> near the surface , the chances are that it is either old or has genuinely been bleached by the sun .
 19225850:  He caught the atmosphere of those grey days when the clouds hang low on the hills and <the colours are sombre> .
 54645176:  But although no two dyes obtained from plants will be exactly alike , <the colours are soft> and subtle , and the mixtures can be blended to give sophisticated hues and tints equal to any of the manufactured colourings .
 83792793:  The colours , the quality and <the colours are fine> .
 85257298:  <The colours are soft> , mainly browns and greens , on a gold and white ground .
 27039119:  `` Most later weights are much lighter , <the colours are muddier> and they do n't have anything like the control over the spacing of the canes . ''

 55038077:  <The colours are bright> and are called fluorescent to distinguish them from the normal opaque colours in the usual felt-tip pens .

 16342919:  <The colours are solid> or with various patterns : red-and-white is often seen among the reds .
 29750832:  That said , it 's still the graphics that impress the most : <the colours are deeper> and sharper than before , the action faster .
 85223330:  <The columns are circular> , very thick and have cubiform capitals .
 50221838:  This time we find and and again , sufficiently nearly , <the columns are orthogonal> .
 88948435:  Surviving remains date chiefly from the Hellenistic period ; in consequence , <the columns are taller> and slenderer than in earlier times and have a wider intercolumniation .
 10750730:  <The columns are available> packed with any of the well known packing media and incorporate a threaded column tube and easy-fit fittings , giving effortless sealing , without constriction of the column tube .
 25468550:  Whatever you choose <the combinations are endless> , even if time consuming , but so enjoyable , there is also the excitement of wearing the finished item .

 32327075:  <The comedians are involved> in Comic Relief projects throughout the year though , Emma said .
 74329170:  I found the windows version easier to use , as all <the commands are available> at the top of the screen in the form of buttons ( in true windows format ) , all you need to do is to click on the required command .
105178643:  To gain a wider appreciation of customer opinion of the trolley service , appraisal cards have been given to passengers on selected routes for their constructive criticism , and overall <the comments are good> .
104290160:  As with the LDCs , <the committees are concerned> with such issues as local establishments , rosters , overtime and holiday arrangements .
 98683046:  But <the commoners are angry> at the threat to the tradition , and say they 'll fight for their land .
 75567856:  A clear communications policy is necessary for both external and internal communications --- and the more hierarchical the structure of the organisation , the more inflexible <the communications are likely> to be .
 29568398:  How do you know that <the companies are reputable> ?
 28489839:  At the moment , all <the companies are state-owned> ; the government wants to sell shares in them , but the dire state of the Tokyo stock market has deterred it so far .
 20170126:  <The companies are likely> to provide basic instruction on how to use the computer .
 19526976:  Unfortunately , as history has shown , some of <the companies are guilty> of misconduct in the pursuit of such profit .
 22831118:  To the extent that <the companies are actual> or potential competitors , the agreement will restrict competition and , if there is an effect on inter-state trade ( which there is likely to be unless production is insignificant ) , there will be a breach of Article 85(1) .
 25016645:  But the way the economy is right now --- all over the world , not just here --- it 's very hard to get a record deal because <the companies are afraid> to sign anyone . ''
101724261:  <The companies are concerned> about planned speed restrictions on Skerne Park through `` sleeping policeman '' type humps in the road , saying they could make journeys slower , uncomfortable and uneconomical .
 45430488:  It is , as far as <the competitors are concerned> , highly professional , extremely and carefully well-organized .
 26472188:  This counts double when <the competitors are male>
 17571507:  All <the complaints are worse> ( < ) cold .
  7117288:  The need is real , or certainly felt to be real , and <the complaints are understandable> .
  1945818:  The ruling in Strasbourg yesterday that <the complaints are admissible> clears the way for a future hearing before the European Court of Human Rights in up to two years ' time .
 59294093:  Open complexes formed at the E.coli rrnB and rrnD P 1 promoters decay within seconds in the presence of heparin ( 9,10 ) , indicating that <the complexes are unstable> and equilibrate rapidly either with free enzyme ( 10 ) or with a closed complex that is sensitive to competitor challenge ( 33 ) .
 94444383:  <The complexities are formidable> , and may well create scope for disputes about the procedures themselves .
 20505808:  <The complications are endless> and the resolution a hilarious bundle of coincidence and tortuous explanation worthy of the worst soap .
 11751551:  Internally , many of <the components are common> to the P3 , P4 and P5 range of cars and across the Land Rover range of boxes , the external and internal components will swap .
 48860537:  When <the components are well-practised> , control passes to a higher level of organisation , and with reading , as we shall be arguing later , the highest level is the integration of word meanings in a comprehension " calculation " .
 25047939:  All <the components are top> quality ( ie. Jackson and Seymour pickups , and Switchcraft , Ernie Ball pots and selector ) .
 86389568:  If <the components are coloured> --- as in the case of pigments and dyes --- the components can be separated visually .
 43763855:  Theta is a famous double ; the separation is 22 seconds or arc , and <the components are equal> .
 43751236:  Telescopes are needed to show the White Dwarf , but binoculars show the main pair clearly , and <the components are separable> with the naked eye .
 10763877:  If <the compounds are toxic> , though , the off-gases may have to be collected and treated , probably by passing them through a granular activated carbon absorber .
 47208769:  None the less , <the concepts are powerful> and provide a way into understanding the more detailed managerial explanations that follow later .
 19977900:  However , the languages of science and engineering have become so specialised that communication across the disciplines is difficult to achieve , but there seems to be no reason in principle why this must be so as <the concepts are universal> .
 98812123:  In the election <the concerns are global> :
 16657994:  Because the control sample of people still at home at second assessment was so small , <no conclusions are possible> .
 59689135:  Another scientist can repeat the experiments to check the results and see if <the conclusions are true> .
 18296419:  It helps , though , if <the conclusions are specific> rather than global or `` motherhood '' .
 27938704:  <The conclusions are obvious> enough : that there was a tendency among some Victorians to have fewer children where they could arrange it that way , and that improved medical care , hygiene , sanitation and living conditions generally were improving life-expectancy and helping to eradicate infant deaths .
 12691167:  And <the conditions are decent> --- not like this . ''
 77951337:  `` Where they die unless <the conditions are suitable> , '' Lucy said .
 74923325:  <The conditions are standard> and most are straightforward but certain ones require comment .
 26958725:  What we imagine or desire is what we get --- within the limits of our potentiality , at a given time , and a given place ; that is , as aforementioned , when <the conditions are conducive> .
 66228452:  However , environments are usually so variable that even if <the conditions are good> where the animal is now , they probably will not be in a month 's time ; it may then be better to be a hundred miles south .
 31215605:  The spores of various fungi are nearly always present in woodwork , just as the germs of many diseases are present in our bodies , but they do not become active unless <the conditions are favourable> .
  3572923:  Two kilometres or so away , over the Swedish border , <the conditions are worse> and these Swedish Lapps have come over to find better feed .

 23873445:  It helps to detail one or two of the other adults to ensure you do not lose anyone on the way but this is a fun activity if <the conditions are right> and the weather reasonable .
104513292:  It has been claimed that adults can also `` pick up '' spoken language in this way ( second language acquisition ) better than by the traditional classroom approach ( second language learning ) if <the conditions are similar> to those experienced by young children .
101483529:  Mr Fallon said : `` I welcome Caldaire 's willingness to move providing <the conditions are right> . ''
103071369:  `` On the other hand I think all <the conditions are right> for the challenge to be successful . ''

  9719016:  The plants here have a dense but high canopy of leaves over them during the summer ; so , apart from the odd shaft of sunlight , <the conditions are overcast> but not dark .
 35144319:  November often brings the odd day of mist and when <the conditions are foggy> , I often ca n't see the point in a tough hill walk when the expansive views of other months are nowhere to be seen .
 38756164:  Because crossing with the blending of parental characters keeps the species constant as long as <the conditions are constant> overall , only changing temporarily and locally .
 35660799:  Being drunk or stoned can make anyone forget to use condoms , but if <the condoms are easy> to see or find there is a better chance that you 'll remember to use them .
 35885297:  <The cones are receptive> to colour and to higher lighting levels .
 24435645:  It pays particular attention to the Corydoras that share its colour pattern like the Corydoras sterbae , haraldschullzi and robinae , but none of <the confrontations are violent> .
  2064487:  <The confrontations are alive> --- and most definitely kicking --- and are as combative , irritable and downright ugly as ever .
 95321054:  Only the <the congratulations are implicit> it seems to me in what you have said to the Labour Group for finding a way out of the problems that you had created .
 14382222:  <The connections are sealed> joints and only the Electricity Board may make these joints and provide the two service wires to each house , where they terminate in a sealed , fused container .
 72155671:  It is clear that <the connections are symmetric>
 94847213:  However , it is not necessary for an employer to prove that <the connections are exclusive> to him and they need not be long established .
 79958453:  Since then he has failed to win but he did show signs of his old ability when third in the Kim Muir at Cheltenham under Ulster 's Paddy Graffin and <the connections are hopeful> that he will run a big race at Aintree .
 45695756:  It feels so good that you think you can get on the gas but <the consequences are terrible> .
 48860503:  The higher-level activity itself can , of course , become automatised , and whereas in the case of skills such as riding a bicycle or tying shoelaces this is advantageous , when it happens to writing or reading <the consequences are unfortunate> .
 67579833:  If , however , the company or the chargee fails to do so <the consequences are grave> indeed for the chargee ; in effect , he loses his security .
 18921580:  If on the other hand <the consequences are neutral> or unpleasant , then the behaviour is less likely to occur and an alternative will be found .
 58578870:  Women face impossible difficulties in trying to combine the roles of mother , paid worker and unpaid domestic worker , and when marriage breaks down <the consequences are obvious> in terms of the vulnerability of lone mothers and their children to poverty .
 22114998:  It is not necessary here to weigh the relative merits of successive waves of public sentiment , and it is too early to guess the judgments of history , but differences between American and British obscenity law can be assessed on their technical merits , and <the consequences are significant> .
102040779:  <The consequences are grave> .
 71942776:  <The consequences are difficult> to prove quantitatively .
 54795363:  Well , <the constants are different> but apart from that eqn ( 2.33 ) , the formula for the electric field of an electric dipole , looks the same .
 68106754:  With an educational heritage created and sustained by men , and in a context in which men control the employment of teachers and the allocation of resources , <the constraints are enormous> .
 38434854:  The great advantage to them of this approach is that it has a strong one-firm concept , where most of the values arid styles of <the consultants are compatible> , thus making it potentially easier to integrate as a consultancy team .
 39979944:  There is a shortlist of four candidates to buy the UK government 's private telephone network , the Evening Standard reports : the paper says <the contenders are British> Telecommunications Plc , Mercury Communications Ltd , Sprint International Inc and OTC Australia --- but not all have decided to bid .
 20376025:  Despite all of the official curriculum plans , there are many instances where <the contents are inappropriate> and still more where the plans themselves are largely responsible for the weakness in implementation .

 27175657:  `` Blind Date 's better --- <the contestants are prettier> , '' he said .
 14983370:  Continental drift could therefore be easily explained by Hess 's hypothesis , since the rocks of the mantle under <the continents are identical> to and continuous with the rocks of the mantle underlying the thin oceanic crust .
 96430253:  Its resources erm <the contrasts are enormous> between the economic and military and cultural and erm educational resources of the United States and that of Fiji so there are obviously , in foreign policy making , vast differences .
 52128898:  Firstly , none of <the contrasts are recurrent> :
 45060822:  <The contrasts are amazing> .
 28234688:  After that , <the contributions are equal> to the regular cost of £50m a year .
 94264539:  A corporation tax deduction will be available to Newco for contributions made to a non-qualifying employee trust provided that : ( a ) <the contributions are regular> and of a revenue nature ; ( b ) the contributions are voluntary ( so as not to constitute annual payments within s337(2) ( b ) TA 1988 ) ; ( c ) the class of beneficiaries under the trust is confined to employees of the settlor company , so there will need to be multiple settlors if all the employees in a group of companies are to benefit and the various companies in the group that are contributing wish to ensure corporation tax deductions ; and ( d ) the companies themselves are entirely excluded from benefiting under the terms of the trust .
 43124755:  if two or more artists collaborate on a project then each can own a separate copyright if <the contributions are distinct> , or they may own joint copyright int he work if this is not the case .
 94264552:  A corporation tax deduction will be available to Newco for contributions made to a non-qualifying employee trust provided that : ( a ) the contributions are regular and of a revenue nature ; ( b ) <the contributions are voluntary> ( so as not to constitute annual payments within s337(2) ( b ) TA 1988 ) ; ( c ) the class of beneficiaries under the trust is confined to employees of the settlor company , so there will need to be multiple settlors if all the employees in a group of companies are to benefit and the various companies in the group that are contributing wish to ensure corporation tax deductions ; and ( d ) the companies themselves are entirely excluded from benefiting under the terms of the trust .
 26508746:  If only it were possible to avoid these difficulties , and go island-hopping where they speak English , where <the controllers are friendly> and helpful , where all kinds of services are readily available , taxes are low and fuel plentiful .
 25019133:  <The controls are standard> volume and tone , with a three-way switch to select one , the other or both , in the fine tradition of twin humbucker guitars .
 24762067:  <The controls are standard> volume and tone , with a three-way pickup selector switch .
 85681321:  But <the controls are complex> because the machine is immensely powerful .
 22546196:  <The controls are pure> joy , though you can be surprised at the ease with which g can pile on in a sixty-degree banked turn at 230 knots .
 24943077:  <The controls are unusual> .
 85681343:  <The controls are simple> but , of course , the machine can do very little by comparison with a warplane .
  7494573:  In general , <the controls are well-positioned> and maximum noise level is 79dBA .
 36355391:  On all ribbers I have ( that is , ribbers to go with punchcard or electronic machines ) <the controls are similar> .
 26588780:  You will find that the model can be moved around on the ground in this state and that all <the controls are effective> .
 63606575:  You can also see well in all directions , <the controls are responsive> and the instrumentation clear .
 23380843:  <The controls are slow> and unresponsive --- let's face it , with the amount of platform beat-'em-ups around you 'd have thought the programmers would 've given a bit more care and attention to this aspect , not to mention the graphics , presentation ... the game in general really .
 46508084:  Most of <the conventions are open> to non-Member States , and countries in all parts of the world are signatories of one or more conventions ; a notable addition was New Zealand which signed the Child Abduction convention in 1991 .
 34951913:  All in all , and despite the failure of the conventions to address the nuclear issue directly , a plausible case can be made that the general principles and fundamental purposes of <the conventions are clear> enough , and are incompatible with virtually any imaginable use of nuclear weapons in war .
 98715708:  Mr French claims a key witness was never called to give evidence and he 's now met with Home Office minister , Michael Jack to explain why he thinks <the convictions are unsafe> .

 37788761:  A final check with a level to ensure <the copings are true> .
 67148188:  A discontinuity known as the Thurber Discontinuity occurs in some Pacific areas : above it <the corals are younger> than 6 000--8 600 years old , depending on the locality , and may represent Post-glacial coral growth when sea level rose above the discontinuity .
 32591262:  Dove-tailed assembly gives them added durability , and <the corners are metal-capped> to prevent scuffing .
 92104507:  Smooth the fondant over the top and down the sides of the cake , making sure that <the corners are smooth> and defined .
 19831902:  However , we can restore the corners without disturbing the edges , and once <the corners are correct> , we can not find ourselves left with a single pair of edges to exchange ( as we shall see later ) .
 23456306:  Dove-tailed assembly gives them added durability , and <the corners are metal-capped> to prevent scuffing .
 92128345:  Smooth into the hollows and around the curves , and make sure that <the corners are neat> .
 55073367:  If <the corrections are long> or numerous the Chairman should ask the Hon.
  6134659:  There are few places in the world where <the costs are higher> than southern California .
  5949372:  Although for many applications <the costs are negligible> , they raise their heads too often to be ignored .
 65120945:  Because as I say if you 've got to clean them up afterwards , <the costs are horrendous> .
102834805:  For women , <the costs are higher> , as their retirement age is lower .
 62602048:  The benefits of homeothermy are apparent from the wide variety of form and lifestyles adopted by birds and mammals , but <the costs are high> .
 54309857:  It seeks , in place of the order made by the judge , an order declaring that the plaintiffs are not entitled to object to any items in the accounts , whether in respect of litigation costs or non-litigation costs , on the ground that <the costs are unreasonable> in amount unless the court has deprived the first defendant , as mortgagee , of the relevant costs .
109874455:  Now it 's perfectly now the cost er the benefits from sort of marketing right to buy is really very , very dubious erm the government has shown time and again that what it takes then gives with one hand , it takes away with another and <the costs are obvious> , we are fragmenting our housing stock , we are putting it , we are likely to end up with more and more with a higher proportion of poor properties and erm there 's also the risk that if we do really have to be promoting right to buy we 're going to have people who are probably not sure whether they can afford to buy their house or are n't sure whether they even want to buy their house .
 50338304:  A distinct advantage is that <the costs are clear> and explicit , inclusive of heating and hot water , without extras --- except perhaps for laundry .
 40558057:  Those are substantial benefits , but <the costs are great> , too : more exchange-rate instability , and the loss of the anti-inflationary discipline provided by fixing the nominal ( as opposed to real ) value of the currency .
 23676451:  <The costs are low> enough for the schemes to be applied to whole towns ... it is estimated that the measures will be amortized within three to six years on account of saved accident costs . ''

101451713:  <The costumes are vivid> and colourful with a distinct Russian feel while the sets are highly imaginative yet subtle .
 23098583:  Although <the costumes are laughable> , the themes are not .
111881084:  <The costumes are traditional> , but the setting ( with a revolving stage in the middle ) is stark , and the lighting fiercely dramatic .
 30697181:  Counselling empathy requires constant testing because we can never be certain that what we believe to be the feelings and attitudes of <the counsellees are accurate> .
 86633258:  <The counsellors are available> to see students every weekday from 9.30 am to 4.30 pm at 7 Buccleuch Place ( first flat ) , and two mornings a week at the King 's Buildings Union , ( first floor , through the Careers Library ) .

 36982348:  <The courses are practical> .

 19067055:  Thirdly , most of <the courses are available> on two levels --- degree and diploma --- with scope for transferability between courses and an element of delayed choice built into all appropriate programmes of study .
 88250313:  Spread over two or more years , <the courses are part-time> and lead to a national examination for the Medau Society Teachers ' Award .
  2396874:  <The courses are powerful> because they provide a link between the newcomers and the local indigenous population who find that working together can help them learn to influence the decision makers . ''
 35216901:  The resources these agencies have available to pursue corporate crime through <the courts are inadequate> in comparison with those available to large national and transnational corporations .
 49322412:  If the body exercising the power has been established especially for that purpose , <the courts are likely> to conclude that Parliament intended the body to act personally .
 94660686:  At least where a right to trial by jury exists , <the courts are reluctant> ( in cases where national security is not involved ) to allow the Attorney-General to side-step it by approaching the High Court for an injunction to stop the publication or for a declaration that the publication is unlawful : The Voluntary Euthanasia Society published a booklet entitled " A Guide to Self-Deliverance " which discussed the pros and cons of committing suicide and described in detail a number of efficacious methods for so doing .
 54479524:  Mr. Beloff , who appeared for Miss Calder , submitted that when <the courts are concerned> today to determine the reach of judicial review , the absence of precedent is not a compelling argument .

 54517785:  <The courts are ignorant> of the underlying Parliamentary purpose .
 53380496:  In the next section we will examine the consequences of not having a rational sentencing policy before asking to what extent <the courts are responsible> for the ensuing crisis , and what options exist for tackling it .
 59030466:  But <the courts are likely> to consider this route inappropriate to family proceedings , said Levy .

 57281606:  The practical utility of the rule depends to some extent upon the means that <the courts are entitled> to employ in order to ascertain what mischief the Act was intended to remedy .
 94832013:  His former employer will quite clearly not benefit from this conduct and <the courts are concerned> with defining how far the employer can restrict such competition .
 49327045:  <The courts are concerned> to see that there is equality of treatment between the parties .
 94844042:  Butler-Sloss LJ said that the meaning of the words " trade secrets " had developed since Herbert Morris v Saxelby and was now interpreted in the wider context of " highly confidential information of a non-technical or non-scientific nature ... " . 1.4 The employee 's skill and knowledge Although <the courts are anxious> to uphold the employer 's right to have his business secrets protected they have ensured that the employee is not prevented from using , once he has left his employer , the general skill and knowledge which he has acquired during employment even though this may have been acquired at some cost to the employer .
 23911022:  It suggests that <the courts are entitled> to be satisfied that certain minimal procedural requirements have been fulfilled but that , thereafter , and provided that they are fulfilled , no objection can be taken to the validity of the Act on grounds of its substantial content .
 44998333:  Hyatt suggests that <the courts are willing> to recognise special circumstances which alter the nature of the relationship .
 35287513:  It is therefore fair to say that , as a general rule , <the courts are prepared> to imply some degree of mobility into every contract of employment but this is likely to be limited unless the nature of the job or work performed by the employee is one where mobility would be recognised by both sides as being essential to the job .
 90943537:  In general , <the courts are reluctant> to allow the doctrine to be used in medical negligence cases unless there is a clear inference of negligence from the known facts .
 94910527:  In general , <the courts are concerned> to enforce contracts between businessmen , especially executed agreements even where the uncertain terms may be meaningless ( Nicolene Ltd v Simmonds [ 1953 ] 1 QB 543 ) .
 94903322:  Nevertheless , especially in the case of executed contracts , <the courts are anxious> to uphold contracts between businessmen ( Foley v Classique Coaches Ltd [ 1934 ] 2 KB 1 ) .
 79087818:  For one reason or another , either it is too long before <the courts are available> to try the cases , or the lawyers appear to require too much time to prepare the defence .
101035958:  `` The council has negotiated more than 250 hours a week free court time for young people and community groups and the firm itself operates an `` open door '' policy , allowing local people access when <the courts are unused> . ''
 44161171:  However , the arguments which underlie the concept of justiciability can also be used to support the idea that in reviewing government decisions over which <the courts are prepared> to exercise control , they should only award remedies to aggrieved parties in cases where it can be said that the respondent has gone wrong in some fairly extreme way .
 12367052:  `` <The courts are apt> to regard a harmless frolic as amounting to adultery , '' she said .
 54072002:  For the above reasons and those contained in the speech of my noble and learned friend , Lord Templeman , which I have had the privilege of reading in draft , I would allow this appeal on the ground that <the courts are entitled> to substitute some different protection in place of the privilege against self-incrimination , providing that such protection can properly be considered as adequate protection .
 14632444:  <The courts are supposed> to be vigilant on behalf of the citizen , and mindful of the liberty to go about one 's lawful business .
 94522913:  <The courts are unlikely> to want to second-guess the exchange on matters of policy or its approach to its functions ; not least because the courts are rarely qualified to judge such issues .
 21163778:  And , from my experience , I can only believe that in some measure , <the courts are guilty> of supporting the police in this attitude , for the sake of maintaining a status quo .
 44996881:  The House of Lords decision in Re an inquiry under the Company Securities ( Insider Dealing ) Act 1985 illustrates clearly how the authorities are determined to take their new powers seriously and how <the courts are prepared> to interpret the provisions in the spirit in which they have been granted .
 53371590:  In this chapter we will chiefly be concerned with three of the most crucial sets of decisions for which <the courts are responsible> : remand decisions ( whether accused persons are freed on bail or remanded in custody ) ; jurisdiction decisions ( whether they are tried in the magistrates ' court or committed for trial in the Crown Court ) ; and sentencing decisions .
 54567049:  Moreover where the issue really does raise a question of esoteric university `` lore '' <the courts are unlikely> to override the decision of the visitor , informed as he will be by the university authorities .
 66153483:  If , for example , the alleged error relates to the construction of a term with which <the courts are familiar> then this will tend towards substitution of judgment , whereas more specific or technical matters will normally lead to a greater degree of discretion being granted to the agency , the legal conclusion being expressed in the form of the rational basis test .
 67920208:  Where the second point of review is concerned , namely whether the actions taken by the constable were reasonable in the light of his apprehensions , <the courts are diffident> about interfering , for a number of reasons .
 35907879:  There are compensations : the cliffs are everywhere impressive , some of <the coves are charming> , and always there are magnificent views across the North Minch to the island of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides .
 16324664:  <The cows are superb> mothers , with good milk yields and a remarkably even lactation curve .
 16355198:  However , <the cows are hardy> sucklers and economic feeders ; they breed regularly for many years on extensive systems and are said to `` age gracefully '' .
 49536538:  Essentially the same structures are found among the Thysanura in the Lepismatidae , though <the coxites are unmodified> there and bear styles .
 37628821:  If <the crampons are horizontal> , even if the ice breaks then the points should bite again lower down if the angle is maintained as the boot drops .
 11746890:  <The crankshafts are different> depending on the type of rear oil seal ( rope type or rubber lip seal ) and can not be swapped without machining.
 37462494:  As <the crayons are oily> , they can be dissolved with turpentine .
100395435:  `` <The creatures are starving> because their food chain is diminishing , '' he said .
 51677807:  From the script it tells you that after this nuclear war <the creatures are supposed> to have decayed into these horrible shapes , almost armless and legless , dependent on machines to give them any mobility .
 18563500:  There are two extremes : either it can be decided that <the creditors are free> to distrain on trust property as on any other ; or else it may be decided that the trust property is exempt from such execution .
 94760085:  The first point is the Revenue could take the simple point that as a matter of law <no credits are available> to the beneficiaries .
  4434725:  <The crews are able> to resuscitate heart attack patients , replace fluid intraveneously after severe blood loss , and insert tubes to maintain air supplies in unconconscious casualties .
 15217694:  <The criteria are supposed> to define the main area of knowledge and understanding , and to specify the skills and competences to be tested in each subject .
 39055700:  Most of <the criteria are electrophysiological> but X- , Y- , and W-cells in the retina may also be distinguished on morphological grounds .
 61710185:  In each field , <the criteria are specific> to the discipline in question .
 85875078:  With so many parameters to consider , it is helpful to have a system ensuring that <the criteria are consistent> and applied in the same order .
 95625909:  In , with regard to the change of wording , erm I think that would probably add to the policy rather than detract from it and I I think the conclusion I would come to is that <the criteria are independent> they 're not and or or .
 59418188:  But <no criteria are sufficient> actually to explain this distinction , and in order to elucidate its meaning it is necessary to consider it in connection with certain modes of experiencing with which it forms a structural unity .
 84163500:  With so many parameters to consider , it is helpful to have a system ensuring that <the criteria are consistent> and applied in the same order .
 28535947:  The rationale behind this argument is that <the criteria are consistent> with the criteria for recognising an asset in the IASC 's Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements .
103876607:  So you 're saying , you 're saying it 's a case where erm if <the criteria are reasonable> in the sense of being required for the what proper operation of market or something like that ?
 99526726:  The sequel 's selling well , but not all <the critics are impressed> .
111228266:  And I think as far as <the critics are concerned> , John Maynard-Smith may allow me to adapt erm the critical misjudgement of all time , which was made by a Dublin Professor when The Origin of Species first came out , which you will remember no doubt
 15954202:  But even if <the critics are right> , and the quality of life for these animals can be improved , this will not change the system in any fundamental way .
 85366253:  <The critics are ignorant> bastards , the audience mercurial bastards and you are incompetent bastards .
 34779386:  It seems to me that it 's better to be an actor as far as <the critics are concerned> .
 41280926:  The process is confined to low-viscosity magmas , such as basalts , in which <the crystals are able> to separate from the active thermal boundary layer during convection .
 41013089:  Females choose to give birth to their one or two young in dens dug into the snow-drifts on mountainsides of places such as the Svalbard Islands , and often stay on the islands during the Arctic summer until <the cubs are old> enough to fend for themselves .
 99421942:  But to secure a conviction they must show prove <the culprits are professional> dealers .
 99426454:  But to secure a conviction they must show prove <the culprits are professional> dealers .
107641725:  oh <the cupboards are brilliant> it 's just the fronts are so dated and the man in these reports in the house said erm , kitchen is satisfactory but it needs updating and it was only about seven years ago it was brand new , no , not seven , have we been in then , no eight , so nine or something , I know the fronts need sorting out .
105643023:  <The cupboards are nice> !
 92390072:  <The curtains are light> at the window .
 66360448:  Its only disadvantage is that it will project the curtain fixture further into the room and when <the curtains are open> the batten will be visible .
 72151062:  Firstly , <the curvatures are likely> to depend linearly on mass ; otherwise a single mass would produce a different effect from that produced by two separate masses brought into contact .

 77230392:  There is only the one room and <the customers are rough> .
 60331558:  Erm we could the the the the needs of <the customers are different> .

 45469436:  Having been soaked , <the cuticles are soft> enough for the manicurist , using an orange stick , to gently push them back .
111437490:  The losses are blamed on the lack of research cash and the need to reorganise , but union leaders says <the cuts are cosmetic> and unnecessary and they may consider industrial action .
101553543:  IN THE article ( Echo February 3 ) in which you report the proposed cuts in the Home Help service , Durham County Hall says <the cuts are necessary> because money is running out .
 39989605:  <The cuts are equivalent> to 9% of the divisional workforce .
 74706066:  The Law Society argues that <the cuts are unlawful> because they are inconsistent with the purpose of legal aid --- `` ensuring that people of small and moderate means receive access to proper legal advice , and to justice '' --- and because there was no proper consultation before the decision to make the cuts were taken .
 94417280:  Suppose <the damages are sufficient> to buy an ordinary annuity for her life of that amount .
 77560930:  <The dams are likely> to increase the incidence of water-borne diseases and have a very short life-span due to the high siltation rate caused by widespread soil erosion .

103702667:  as <the dances are concerned> .

 40438090:  Now <the dangers are smaller> , but could come from almost anywhere .
 77361999:  But he agrees that <the dangers are easier> to foresee --- the opportunities have to be realized by human determination , individuals working together .
 98671258:  <The dangers are clear> to see .
 99181973:  But while <the dangers are real> , there 's also a risk that children are being over-protected .
 52388537:  Here <the dangers are real> .
 21461239:  <The dates are significant> , for they show that the spirit which ruled in the Italian city republics had noisy echoes in Germany and France --- all over northern Europe indeed ; and that Italy and the northern communes were not so far apart as the northern monarchs and many modern historians have wished them to be .
 31913932:  <The dates are relevant> in that they merge in with meetings and other interactions between the BYU and the University of Utah team and with the developing programme of the latter group .
 13678062:  The dates on the letters are quite clear , but a vague possibility is that they refer to the first actual parachute operation and that <the dates are confused> --- by perhaps a month .

 29742405:  Yet <the dealers are respected> members of the community .
 86468877:  Only <the dealers are worried> .
 86468971:  In an atmosphere of such buoyancy <the dealers are obliged> to cut margins and try to survive competition from the opportunists for whom the fax boom is simply the latest in a long line of nice little short-term earners , such as double-glazing and car phones .

 67571473:  Hence in practice there will be no problems arising from restrictions on transferability or from a company 's lien ; debentures will invariably provide that the money expressed to be secured will be paid , and that <the debentures are transferable> , free from any equities or claims between the company and the original or any intermediate holder .
  1016050:  <The decisions are commercial> : what will earn the best return on the investment ?

 54313253:  We do not think the criterion can be put any better or more clearly than it is put in R.S.C. , Ord. 62 , r. 12(2) and would hold that , on the true construction of the 18 February 1985 mortgage , <the defendants are entitled> to be paid or to retain out of the mortgaged property all their actual costs , charges and expenses ( including the receivers ' remuneration ) except in so far they are of an unreasonable amount or have been unreasonably incurred and with any doubts as to whether the costs have been reasonably incurred or are reasonable in amount being resolved in favour of the defendants .
 54380786:  Mr. Beazley submitted that the court 's decision in paragraphs 17 and 18 of the judgment , which is also reflected in the answer given to the question in the court 's ruling , is conclusive in his favour and determinative of the construction of article 5(3) ; and that in consequence articles 5(1) and 5(3) are to be construed as mutually exclusive , but as all-embracing so far as actions to establish any kind of liability of <the defendants are concerned> .
 54132801:  It is alleged by the plaintiff that the use of these roads by numerous heavy goods vehicles at night amounts to a public nuisance for which <the defendants are responsible> : the dock company because it controls the Gillingham Gate and by its operation of the gate and the port in general causes or permits the heavy goods vehicles to go in and out of it at all hours , and the fourth and fifth defendants , Crescent Wharves Ltd. and Ship Link Terminals Ltd. respectively , because as sublessees of the dock company they or their customers send heavy goods vehicles in and out of the port and cause or materially contribute to the alleged nuisance .
 94548072:  If the case has not been issued , but <the defendants are slow> to agree costs , consider issuing solely for the interest provisions and argue that the defendants caused this course of action .
 54251110:  `` Assuming the allegations set out in the statement of claim to be true , whether <the defendants are liable> in tort to the plaintiff for such of those acts and/or omissions as were committed before the plaintiff 's birth .

 13372358:  The package index is not a precision tool but in practice variations between packages can be in the order of 2--300 per cent so <the differences are likely> to exceed percentage error .

 54517123:  Although the practical reasons for the rule ( difficulty in getting access to Parliamentary materials and the cost and delay in researching it ) are not without substance , they can be greatly exaggerated : experience in Commonwealth countries which have abandoned the rule does not suggest that <the drawbacks are substantial> , provided that the court keeps a tight control on the circumstances in which references to Parliamentary material are allowed .
 19980264:  But , as with the wealth of other experiments that matrix isolation has made possible , <the drawbacks are insignificant> compared with the value of the techniques as , sometimes , the only tool with which to examine the inner workings of chemical reactions .

 89131068:  If <the drivers are present> , then you must check the following points :
103056581:  Although my elder two sons are experts in Streetcleaner Two , Sonic the Warthog and Attack of the Psychopathic Hippopotami , they live in Glasgow , where fast reaction times and knowledge of weird mutant creatures is necessary for survival on the no-mean-city streets , where <the drivers are worse> than the megabytten monsters .

 72458319:  It is thus apparent , as has been indicated elsewhere , that not all of <the earthworks are contemporary> with one another ; indeed , the basic outline of the settlement seems to have been determined by land divisions laid down several thousand years previously .

 17007202:  Rulers should be perspex so you can see underneath them as you rule ; check <the edges are smooth> .
 92542550:  Not all <the editors are guilty> : the volumes prepared by Busser , Guilmant , Hahn , Marty and Debussy , for instance , may not measure up to today 's scholarly standards , but in most respects they do not seriously misrepresent the composer 's intentions .
 20149434:  <The editors are aware> of the dangers accompanying the recent transformation of AI from ugly duckling to golden-egg-laying goose : `` The crisis we now face is a crisis of success , and many wonder if the substance of the field can support the high hopes . ''
105544744:  The portrayal of many incidents of rape and beating are so carefully and tactfully described that <the effects are realistic> and pitiful .
 70084445:  This is because of the great importance of infant mortality , the weightiest component of life expectancy and general mortality in developing countries , and also because a large body of observations concerning <the effects are available> not only from developed but also from developing countries and which are much more reliable than data on fetal mortality .
 21864052:  Many of <the effects are indistinguishable> from the normal processes of growing up .
 31145452:  There is a great deal of evidence which indicates that experiences in early childhood are very important , and that <the effects are long-lasting> .

 89799945:  Further studies have shown that these effects are not restricted to omeprazole treatment , but are also found during treatment with other H + /K + -ATPase inhibitors and high dose H 2 receptor antagonists , suggesting that <the effects are secondary> to profound , long term acid inhibition .
 33550038:  In true body-building style , <the effects are cumulative> so start your routine now !
 58189909:  If <the effects are large> , and a more general no-arbitrage condition relaxing the assumption can not be derived , then the validity of the no-arbitrage condition is conditional on the relevant assumption .
 19389420:  Whatever the exact cause , <the effects are clear> .

103299584:  `` In order for them not to happen the law would have to be changed and , with the time it would take to change the law , we would n't be able to do so before <the elections are due> to happen .
 37251358:  <The elections are likely> to return a Centre Right majority in the National Assembly , and France would therefore begin a new period of `` cohabitation '' , that is , a President and a Prime Minister from different parties .
 29287144:  I am a strong advocate of the strictest economy , and feel that spending money extravagantly means still higher rates and higher rents , which manufacturers , shopkeepers and the whole of <the electors are unable> to bear .
 50186008:  They may , for example , all be functions of time , so that we must write A = A(t) ; they may be functions of a parameter , typified by when <the elements are rational> integral functions of{ gl } , the matrix is called a lambda-matrix ; or the elements may themselves ( especially for vectors ) be independent variables .
  5331200:  `` <The elements are Sinaitic> and proto-Sinaitic .

103922423:  Now what I 'm saying to you is that there 's a big question mark as far as Goodey er report is concerned and they can talk about er the surpluses , they can talk about the trustees , but there 's no majority as far as <the employees are concerned> and this was the question mark that we we were saying that one of the reasons why they were saying you know that the employee should be in the minority because in the end paragraph of the summing up of the Goodey report that states quite clearly that all the responsibility and all the [unclear] but the employer , now you yourself has said that er as far as the schemes and we 're talking of something in the region of a hundred and twenty eight thousand .

 85241392:  At <the ends are gigantic> multi-light windows ( 460 ) .

 64701093:  <The errors are likely> to be most significant during the initiation of climb or descent , or on levelling out following a change in pitch attitude .
 73579179:  If a total of less than 1% of the population is undefined then <the errors are unlikely> to be great , but the reliability of the moments decreases sharply as the proportions of undefined materials increases , and the technique should not be used with a higher proportion of unknowns notwithstanding the convenience and availability of pocket calculators suitable to perform the arithmetic .
 89305276:  An aborted DC can still be used as a basis for a new DC , using option 2.1.2 , Update DC , if the volume of detail is large and <the errors are minor> .

 64701046:  <The errors are likely> to be more significant during changes of pitch attitude than during manoeuvres involving roll or yaw , since in normal flight configurations the latter manoeuvres tend to be smaller in amplitude and duration than is the case with pitch changes .
 40940566:  `` <The esoterics are powerless> ; lost .
 43733370:  Sometimes <the estimates are discordant> , but a little practice will work wonders , and variable star work has become an important branch of modern amateur astronomy .

 40828196:  <The experts are even-handed> in apportioning blame among EC governments .
 86003898:  <The explanations are various> and , as I argue shortly , rather limited .
 38169428:  Although the sea is a much more stable environment than the air and the habitat enjoyed by land animals , fluctuations occur which have a special influence on the shore , where <the extremes are greater> , and cold air temperatures can influence the fauna in winter , and the concentrated rays of the sun can make some pools uninhabitable during the summer .
 20139534:  Between <the extremes are solid> modellers that treat an image as if it were solid --- a kind of `` clay model '' in a computer .

 49037352:  There have been suggestions that some of these experiences , especially the sequences of geometrical shapes , or flashes , may be the result of discharges from the retina occurring in the absence of any stimulation --- the so-called entoptic phenomenon --- which can also be observed when <the eyes are open> in the pitch-dark .
 63879830:  The colours are vile , <the fabrics are scratchy> and horrible .
 37892496:  The claws are stone-veined , scaled , seething ; <the faces are deformed> , diabolic , hate-filled .

  2685543:  By themselves <the facts are neutral> but in so far as moral views about the proper role of the media are based upon presumptions about facts , our empirical findings are bound to have moral implications .
 26919583:  <The facts are easy> to assemble .
 71159153:  <The facts are simple> .
 93161719:  But <the facts are complicated> here by the shift from that to this to show empathy , and from this to that to show emotional distance ( Lyons ( 1977a : 677 ) calls this empathetic deixis ; see Fillmore , 1971b : 227 and R. Lakoff 1974 for the intricacies of English usage ) .
 66942025:  Whatever view one takes of this matter , <the facts are indisputable> .

 85827077:  In between the branches of <the fibrils are amorphous> areas and these , along with the amorphous interfacial regions between the lamellae , make up the disordered content of the semi-crystalline polymer ( figure 11.8 ) .

 12423275:  Here , in the valley , the world seems to be constructed on a smaller and more delicate scale ; <the fields are mere> paddocks , so reduced that from this height their hedgerows appear a network of dark-green threads overspreading the paler green of the grass ... such is the vale of Blackmoor . ''
   497846:  Obviously , if <the fields are small> , two lengths might be needed .
 88624699:  However a few were experimenting with this newest innovation and looking around the Orkney countryside today well there 's hardly a farm that does n't have a covered silage pit or a grain silo and today <the fields are full> of barley and oilseed rape and a field of turnips is something of a rare sight these days .
 56778855:  Here <the fields are small> ... and the hedges often tall and deep , leafy with trees of all ages as hedgerow saplings grow up to replace the dying giants ... .
 85686596:  Plainly , <the figures are impressive> but they fall far short of the early hopes that computing might have a pervasive influence on school education .
 56847344:  Drawing and painting are narrative arts where <the figures are concerned> not with the spectator but with one another and the action they are taking part in , so the opposite convention prevails : they are normally shown with faces and feet in profile .

 96255023:  Erm the Labour Party is absolutely furious that unemployment goes down in this country and they keep trying to say to the public that it 's all hooey and , and , and , and <the figures are distorted> etc. , etc. , The fact is unemployment is going down , we are overcoming the recession , er faster than any other member of the er European Community or the European union as it 's now concerned and , and these are the facts but having said all that , we on this side er certainly support a continuing strategy whether we 'll er have to continue spending money at this level , er I do n't know , hopefully er the , the recession will be overcome and the spending can be reduced , but the strategy we believe .
 59002335:  <The figures are different> to the perception of those not incontinent who were asked the same question : 71% ( 2564 ) thought that the condition would have a great deal or fair amount of effect on their lifestyle and only 20% ( 692 ) not much or none at all .
 59003408:  <No figures are available> to compare to those in this study as to people 's perception of the causes of urinary incontinence .
 98753701:  Britain 's trade gap narrowed in February to seven hundred and fifty million pounds from eight hundred and fifty-eight million , but <the figures are worse> than expected by City analysts .

 98742503:  <The figures are sad> but we are in the middle of a recession

 43826464:  It is true that his average support score during his presidency was 76 per cent ( Johnson 's was 83 per cent , and <no figures are available> for Roosevelt ) , but such scores are of only limited value as a measure of a president 's relationship with the legislature .
  2611562:  ( <The figures are hypothetical> ) .
 85237215:  The drapery still has a formalised austerity of line , while <the figures are serene> and of a stylised , elongated proportion ( PLATES 58 , 59 and 60 ) .

 15853505:  <No figures are available> from the Agriculture Departments on the land areas gripped each year --- the data is incorporated in the total field drainage figures and can not be separated --- but several schemes in the Pennines and the Welsh uplands have caused significant damage on blanket bogs in the past .
 35758274:  <The figures are breathtaking> , too , as a random sampling will illustrate .
 56457106:  Fig. 6.18 shows a plot of Lum et al. 's figures on the basis of average accesses per retrieval ; it appears from the curves that consecutive spill is only useful for larger bucket sizes , but <the figures are misleading> , as the chained overflow was to a separate file area , necessitating head movement .
104960263:  `` I think <the figures are alarming> .

  8348977:  <The films are fascinating> documents ; but they are more besides .
 95229307:  Someone 's got to check <the filters are right>
100973801:  But <the finalists are likely> to share 50 per cent of the available tickets about 40,000 and if Liverpool get through they might be given a slightly bigger share because of their 35,000 average home gates .

 43361724:  For grass roots workers , <the findings are important> as may are worried about how to intervene in cases of physical abuse , the stress involved and the fact that it may be too complex .
 32335573:  <The findings are due> to be discussed at a future meeting of Braintree District Council 's community and leisure committee .
 58860571:  For the two sets of analyses <the findings are similar> , but the data overlap .
 93481959:  The researchers , whose findings are published in Nature , say that <the findings are consistent> with those to be expected as a result of the greenhouse effect , but warn that they can not be sure " whether this is part of an overall climate change trend , or the normal variability of this section of the Tasman Sea " .
 41678116:  However , where comparisons can be made with alternative sources of data , and where it is possible to provide some evidence to counter the possibility that <the findings are due> purely to `` data collection '' effects , we can perhaps arrive at some tentative conclusions .
 50862642:  If a group of finds whose date is known is found with others of unknown date , it is likely that all <the finds are contemporary> , although if this association of finds happens only once , doubt lingers about its accuracy .
 91019135:  Chapter 12 , for example , is a list of crimes in Wessex for which <the fines are payable> to the king , while chapter 18 states how often borough and shire courts should meet .
 99323558:  So as prostitutes are being deterred from Swindon by big fines and clear up campaigns , they 're taking the problem elsewhere ; to the cities like London , where <the fines are low> and demand for their work is high .
 67547551:  The open palm is also an effective weapon , because <the fingers are free> to convert into finger jabs at the throat or eye gouges .
 14923447:  They have a very similar pattern of elements --- the humerus is like the femur <the fingers are similar> to the toes --- but the detailed form is clearly very different .
 24408483:  <The fins are gold-edged> with dark stripes , and there are white filaments on the anal fin .
 13890197:  All <the fins are dark> grey .
 53747957:  In my opinion they are also one of the most attractively patterned , with a marbled effect on the base colour of silver grey on the developed chest area , while <the fins are clear> .
 53747546:  All <the fins are clear> except the dorsal fin which has black at the base moving up into light yellow with a dark black edging to the dorsal fin tipped with yellow .

 57746013:  The first is where <the firms are unwilling> to accept the judgment of the competition policy institution , and wish to have the case reviewed .
 40745849:  Among <the firms are big> civil-engineering companies like Brown & Root , Bechtel and Peter Kiewit Sons .
 73469283:  Note that we are assuming that both sets of firms sell their output at the price p t and that they have identical real wage elasticities of demand ( - {GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA} ) : that is , <the firms are identical> in every respect other than the timing of their wage contracts .
 57735653:  We identify an ideal where there is a public competition policy institution empowered to identify , investigate , and propose remedies for failures of competition , with a competition tribunal to review cases where the institution is proposing fines for abuses , or where <the firms are unwilling> to accept the initial findings .
 57755292:  In the former case <the firms are involved> in a co-operative game , the problem is to reach agreement on division of the gains from co-operation .
110071172:  But there it is , and outside and foreign firms will put money in , especially if subsidized by temporary government measures , for as you know , public investment in private industry is judged to be ideologically correct , while public investment for public and community concerns is judged ideologically to be harmful , but <the firms are interested> in making money out of the region if I may so put it , not in sustaining world promotion and healthy living in the region .
 64357516:  If <the firstfruits are good> , so will the main crop be .
 93524131:  The animals suffocate after being trapped in the nets , and <the fishermen are reluctant> to cut them free due to the high cost ( US$20 ) of replacing the nets .
 69063921:  The Library 's teams --- winners of last year 's competition --- did not fare so well this time , coming in 9th and 10th out of 14 teams , but <the fishermen are hopeful> of winning back the trophy for the Library next year .

 23017115:  Oil legstraps , check that all <the fittings are secure> and get any minor repairs done now .
 80136978:  Most of <the fixtures are likely> to be switched to the turf at sister track Southwell , though some will have to be staged elsewhere .
 45177028:  `` <The flags are ideal> for the worst eroded stretches as the stone will blend with the environment and integrate into the landscape ... , '' he said .
 69997540:  <The flatmates are used> to the girl 's rugged pick-ups , but Spunk ( cracking nuts with his teeth , eating unshelled eggs and raw sausages ) is a new wrinkle .
 69770307:  <The flats are self-contained> , and the other occupants do n't know when he 's there or not .
 60276041:  Erm d now <the flats are quieter> , do you find there are as many blues on the flats ?
108270144:  I mean some of <the flicks are fantastic> .
 46032839:  This makes a lot of sense , according to Angela Sommerville because , `` the weather is too hot , <the flights are congested> and the island is packed with tourists '' .
 42975893:  Nevertheless the load factors have consistently increased until most days now <the flights are full> . ''
111364248:  And the other fear , of course , was that the cost of fuel is going to go out literally through the roof , if you 'll excuse the pun , erm that does n't seem to have happened , so again presumably they the tour operators will be able to hold prices , certainly as far as <the flights are concerned> ?
 36349347:  One advantage of these fabrics is that <the floats are shorter> than in conventional Fair Isle knitting .
 77677692:  It might be necessary to lever up the floorboard while it is being cut and if <the floorboards are tongue-and-grooved> , some tongues need to be cut off .

 92431007:  In the canopy , <the flowers are larger> and more conspicuous , as in almost all of the emergents .
 86293660:  Although two red-flowered snapdragons , when crossed , produce exclusively red-flowered offspring ; and two white-flowered snap dragons , when crossed , produce exclusively white-flowered progeny ; the result of crossing red-flowered with white-flowered plants gives an F1 generation in which all <the flowers are pink> .
107596354:  <The flowers are nice> .
 99382759:  <The flowers are insignificant> , but the plants do n't die after blooming .
 54665448:  If the dandelion was a rare plant , it would be thought a highly desirable garden species , since <the flowers are large> and brilliantly yellow .
 54663187:  Removal of the flower-stems before flowering increases leaf production , but <the flowers are pretty> , and leaves are always present , even if fewer .
 34430077:  <The flowers are small> and white , but the freshness of the foliage makes this plant so appealing .
 30798551:  For instance , you could use leaves in tones of golden brown and orange , with flowers in shades of cream , pale green and silver , for one picture , then reverse the colours in the other picture so that the foliage is in the pale shades and <the flowers are orange> and golden brown .
 60465179:  <The flowers are amusing> , but dreadfully vulgar .
  7684259:  Like Nicotiana langsdorfii , <the flowers are pretty> and intriguing but the plant as a whole is not showy in our climate , making too much stem and leaf .
 92163505:  But our main interest is in the cases when <the fluctuations are non-periodic> , as in Figs. 24.2 and 24.3 .
 92167149:  The intermittency factor , defined as the fraction of the time that <the fluctuations are chaotic> , varies continuously across the transition zone from 0 at the ordered side to 1 at the fully chaotic side .

 20805848:  Danon does n't quite capture the swing that ties these dances to their Romanian background ( <the folktunes are genuine> ) --- perhaps surprisingly , in view of his Yugoslav origins : it 's only down the road , after all .

 54793265:  If the cross-section happens to be smaller at a certain place , then <the forces are larger> there than at the neighbouring cross-sections , so the beam will be further constricted , etc. , leading to the so-called sausage instability ( Fig. 3.3(a) ) .
 72141819:  <The forces are larger> than in the experiment of Roll , Krotkov , and Dicke but the torque can only be reversed by bodily rotating the apparatus , which gives large and irreversible effects that vitiate the method .
 76733997:  <The forests are infinite> .
 38874304:  <The forests are full> of all kinds of spiders , and the Forest Goblins are experts when it comes to capturing and finding uses for these creatures .
 64116119:  <The forests are dwindling> , thousands of deer starve to death every winter , and those that survive to be shot by rich outsiders for the profit of absentee landlords are about half the size of their European cousins .
 39543518:  <The forests are wild> and dangerous places , although there are towns and innumerable villages situated within the woodlands .
 17316233:  These grow rapidly and now some of <the forests are ready> for cutting and replanting .
  4204212:  We are helping to set up protected National Parks and helping communities to `` harvest '' the forests , so they see how much more valuable <the forests are intact> than cut down .
 74795562:  Vibration problems at BPXC 's wells are more dramatic and commonplace than elsewhere because <the formations are hard> and the holes tend to be extremely enlarged due to wellbore `` breakout '' phenomena , so that the drillstring easily loses stability .
 75519390:  <The forms are available> from your Divisional or Section Head who is responsible for ensuring that completed forms are returned to the Administrative Officer ( Personnel ) .
100278699:  `` I have been told <the forms are private> and confidential , but by the time you finish filling them in , your whole life is there for someone to see . ''
 70923878:  It is a problem not easily solved by the classic methods of stratigraphical palaeontology , as obviously we will land ourselves immediately in an impossible circular argument if we say , firstly that a particular lithology is synchronous on the evidence of its fossils , and secondly that <the fossils are synchronous> on the evidence of the lithology .
 88449971:  <The foundations are illusory> .
 90925166:  An engineer 's report states that <the foundations are defective> and that the house will need underpinning and the foundations repaired .
 71699107:  The barracks should have been torn down years ago , but the fort 's current proprietors , the Archaeological Survey of India , have lovingly continued the work of decay initiated by the British : white marble pavilions have been allowed to discolour ; plasterwork has been left to collapse ; the water channels have cracked and grassed over ; <the fountains are dry> .
  1195534:  Their drawbacks are that <the frames are prone> to serious condensation unless a thermal break is incorporated in their construction , and uncoated types may suffer surface corrosion in industrial or coastal areas .
 33090180:  <The frames are rotten> , which has led to distortion
 53734381:  CAPTURE the whole picture with a long-format disposable camera --- <the frames are double> the normal 35 mm width .
 29523808:  Their drawbacks are that <the frames are prone> to serious condensation , unless a thermal break is incorporated in their construction , and anodised types may suffer surface corrosion in industrial or coastal areas ( although very few of these are sold these days ) .
 73528105:  In this range <the frequencies are comparable> with those of molecular vibrations , which are generally between 10 11 and 10 13 Hz , corresponding to 30--3000 cm -1 .
 24895178:  Set into the 16'' radius fingerboard are 22 jumbo frets with dot position markers ; <the frets are smooth> and really well finished .
 24759406:  <The frets are similar> to those of the Classic and the workmanship once again well up to scratch .
 23793001:  In the spring young shoots will be damaged by such frosts and , if <the frosts are severe> or prolonged , they may be killed .
 69508118:  But someone told me that it is not the same as the passion fruit on sale at the shops and that <the fruits are poisonous> .
  5685876:  All <the fruits are available> , but you must ensure that your local shopkeeper realises that you want , and are prepared to pay for , the best .
 49940157:  <The functions are concerned> with how this system is used for communicative ends .

  3985660:  <The fungi are parasitical> and can only live by feeding on organic matter , including wood and leaves .
  9431074:  It will be some time before Stewart can begin on the interior decor , but <the furnishings are likely> to be medieval in flavour , if contemporary in colour , with heavy tapestries draped from the walls and fittings boxed into the panelling .
 45070590:  Set in the hillside , <the furnishings are elegant> and dotted with fine antiques .
  4213417:  <The furnishings are pretty> , a mixture of modern and antique , and the rooms are full of light and colour , with large vases of flowers and pot plants liberally scattered about .
 11396793:  Instead of being about the size and shape of a coin , <the fusulines are spindle-shaped> , with a round cross-section tapering at both ends ; fusuline limestones again form thick rock sequences , particularly in Russia and the Orient .
 87047702:  You must remember that <the gaberlungi are real> elements of legend .
 93192985:  That to the bottom left is badly drawn at the base , the foot is crooked and <the gadroons are smaller> at the left than to the right .
 27195394:  Most of <the gags are offensive> and cruel but some are very funny indeed .
 53569813:  Given that resources are limited , they would have to be concentrated where the need is most pressing and where <the gains are likely> to be substantial .
 12642830:  Most galaxies are pathetic objects called dwarf galaxies --- so dim that astronomers ca n't even seem them unless <the galaxies are close> to us .
 79374424:  Surely the test of all this is not necessarily how big the Government grant for acquisitions is but what <the galleries are able> to acquire .
 44604690:  From Lugano it was fine because the winter is always six months and everything is closed in any case , but here <the galleries are open> the whole year and the museum is easier to get to .
 53651439:  <The games are fun> . ''
  4675608:  It has good colours and , although it uses a Zilog Z-80 processor , like the Spectrum , <the games are fast> .
 34407886:  But it is cheaper than the other machines and <the games are excellent> .
  5204330:  <The games are addictive> , and I carry it whenever I 'm likely to be bored somewhere .
 40431885:  <The gangsters are big> in Osaka .
 67147824:  The first is the absence of deep gaps in barrier reefs and atolls , whereas if subsidence has been long continued , there should be deep gaps present , because once <the gaps are deeper> than the depth at which reef-building corals occur they can not be filled by coral growth .
 66492761:  <The gardens are full> of Aleppo pine and citrus trees ... ''
 49953718:  The local stone here is gritstone , much of it brought down I suspect from the quarries on the flanks of Penhill , and on a summer 's evening , when the children are playing on the swings and people are sat talking quietly in the dying sunlight outside the pub while an old dog wanders across the green sniffing his way towards the children , then , when every building is tinted with amber and <the gardens are heavy> with blooms , it could well be said to be " t'prattiest lal spot i't'Dales " .
 77050044:  `` Because although it 's a handsome house , and <the gardens are extensive> , they in no way compare to those of the castle which is just up the road . ''

 93229624:  But at the rate emissions of CFCs are growing , <the gases are likely> to overtake carbon dioxide as principal contributors to the global warming problem .
 11404987:  Perhaps more than any other group of molluscs <the gastropods are remarkable> for the variety and beauty of the external sculpture on the shell , which may be covered with a delicate tracery of ribs and lines , or stout spines , or fine prickles .
 14694143:  This is your room , hello , we 'll have to fix that bulb , may I ask you not to flush the toilet between the hours of eleven at night and seven in the morning while the sanitation department is still in , do n't be alarmed , cockroaches are a way of life in this part of the world , <the gekkos are friendly> too , although they wo n't eat the spiders .
 35499717:  Although all Piaroa are considered kinsmen , division does exist , of course : there is the factional politicking of the ruwatu ; each individual has dangerous affines , even if they are also kin ; men have different roles to play from women , and because of their difference in cultural capabilities <the genders are dangerous> for one another , a difference somewhat marked in ritual .
 32414950:  Frequently , however , <the generalisations are crude> and misleading and antagonism is explicitly or implicitly present .
 14178111:  But if we look more carefully we find that , as far as <the genes are concerned> , their destiny is largely shared .
 13584282:  <The gentlemen are liable> to retire to the smoking room at any moment . ''
111027221:  That 's probably overstating it , but certainly in its regional and local aspects we do deal with many environmental problems <the geographers are familiar> with .
    88708:  <The geographies are similar> .

108638859:  it 's not gon na give you any pleasure to say , oh well at least all <the girls are alright> .
 51430784:  <The girls are silent> and staring
110763159:  you are the reason why I left the school , you know , none of <the girls are happy> by their upper sixth , in the lower sixth you might think it 's alright but by the time [unclear]

 19107368:  He makes the point that it is not sufficient to ask `` How well does the course achieve its goals ? '' one must consider whether <the goals are worthwhile> or not : `` How good is the course ? ''
 85103851:  " In such an organization <the goals are inconsistent> and ill-defined , the technology for achieving them is unclear to the members , and those involved in decision-making vary unpredictably .
 43597129:  Members may be attracted because the group offers the opportunity for affiliation , recognition or security , or because <the goals are significant> to the individuals , or because they have expectations that the group will satisfy their personal goals and motives .
 67790944:  <the goals are diverse> and changing ;
 60464461:  <The goats are white> too , a little herd of souls .
 94935558:  Indeed the Law Commission Working Paper No 77 , Implied Terms in Contracts for the Supply of Goods ( 1977 ) , recognised three possible approaches : firstly , the bailor is strictly liable ( Jones v Page ( 1867 ) 15 LT 619 per Kelly CB at p621 ) ; secondly , the goods must be as fit as care and skill can make them ( Hyman v Nye ( 1881 ) 6 QBD 685 per Lindley J at p682 ) ; thirdly , the bailor is liable only if he fails to take reasonable care to ensure that <the goods are fit> which , as the via media of the two other approaches , was eventually adopted in s9 of SGSA 1982 .
 60016972:  You 're only entitled to money back if <the goods are faulty> in some way .
 94865392:  Thus instead of writing If the Seller shall have given the Buyer notice that the goods are ready for collection , and the Buyer shall fail to collect them within seven days from service of such notice , the Seller shall be entitled to make arrangements for the storage of the goods and the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller all costs and charges incurred as a result of such storage the drafter could write If after the Seller has given the Buyer notice that <the goods are ready> for collection , the Buyer fails to collect the goods within seven days , the Seller may make arrangements for the storage of the goods and the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller all costs and charges incurred as a result of such storage .
 94865322:  Thus instead of writing If the Seller shall have given the Buyer notice that <the goods are ready> for collection , and the Buyer shall fail to collect them within seven days from service of such notice , the Seller shall be entitled to make arrangements for the storage of the goods and the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller all costs and charges incurred as a result of such storage the drafter could write If after the Seller has given the Buyer notice that the goods are ready for collection , the Buyer fails to collect the goods within seven days , the Seller may make arrangements for the storage of the goods and the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller all costs and charges incurred as a result of such storage .
 94865731:  A better version would therefore read : If the Seller gives the Buyer notice that <the goods are ready> for collection but the Buyer fails to collect the goods within seven days of service of that notice , the following provisions shall apply : ( a ) the Seller may make arrangements for the storage of the goods until they are collected and ( b ) the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller all costs and charges incurred in connection with the storage of the goods .
 94853000:  Obviously this is only a general rule : in particular , where <the goods are complicated> , or where the normal course of dealing would so indicate , it may be relatively easy to establish that the parties did not intend their agreement to become binding until other details were finalised ; this issue is examined further in Chapter 4 , 6 below .
 94933711:  This phenomenon can also be seen in trading stamp transactions so that s4(1) of the Trading Stamps Act 1964 ( substituted by s16(1) of SOGIT 1973 ) provides : In every redemption of trading stamps for goods , notwithstanding any term to the contrary on which the redemption is made , there is --- ( a ) an implied warranty on the part of the promoter of the trading scheme that he has a right to give the goods in exchange ; ( b ) an implied warranty that <the goods are free> from any charge or encumbrance not disclosed or known to the person obtaining the goods before , or at the time of redemption and that that person will enjoy quiet possession of the goods except so far as it may be disturbed by the owner or other person entitled to the benefit of any charge or encumbrance so disclosed or known ; ( c ) an implied warranty that the goods are of merchantable quality , except that there is no such warranty ( i ) as regards defects specifically drawn to the attention of the person obtaining the goods before or at the time of redemption ; or ( ii ) if that person examines the goods before or at the time of redemption , as regards defects which that examination ought to reveal .
 57771902:  If <the goods are close> substitutes , competition between them will drive price down near to marginal cost .
 77761143:  ( a ) <the goods are free> , and will remain free until the time when the property is to pass , from any charge or encumbrance not disclosed or known to the buyer before the contract is made , and
 94947199:  The trader has the right to make representations that <the goods are safe> and to have the notice revoked .
 94865599:  This structure is followed in the example given above and can be broken down as follows : If after the Seller has given the Buyer notice that <the goods are ready> for collection [ case ] , the Buyer fails to collect the goods within seven days [ condition ] , the Seller [ subject ] may make arrangements for the storage of the goods [ action ] and the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller all costs and charges incurred as a result of such storage .
 94328583:  If the Seller shall be unable , through circumstances beyond its control ( including without limitation lack of shipping instructions from the Purchaser ) , to deliver the goods within 14 days after notification to the Purchaser or its agent that <the goods are ready> for delivery , the Seller shall be entitled to arrange storage on behalf of the Purchaser , whereupon delivery shall be deemed to have taken place , all risk in the goods shall pass to the Purchaser , and delivery to the Purchaser of the relevant warehouse receipt shall be deemed to be delivery of the goods for the purposes of Condition 4 .
 60023013:  But if <the goods are faulty> you 'd have the right to decline the credit note and ask for money back .
 60022926:  But that brings us back to the point we were stressing a moment ago , if <the goods are faulty> you 're entitled to money back , a cash refund .
 77723069:  This question will be important if Z wishes to sue his seller for breach of contract ( e.g. if <the goods are defective> ) or if Z fails to pay the price .
 58543868:  where <the goods are perishable> or are doing considerable damage to the land and it is impossible to communicate speedily enough with the occupier or his agent ) .
 46350420:  Under the Consumer Credit Act , items costing more than £100 are protected if the supplier fails to deliver or <the goods are faulty> .
 60022063:  But if <the goods are faulty> what you 're entitled to by law is money back .
 24780890:  The Sale of Goods Act 1979 only gives you an entitlement to money back if <the goods are faulty> , misdescribed or not fit for the purpose you requested them to perform .
 60021972:  You should always be entitled to a refund provided <the goods are faulty> .
 94892919:  Thus , for instance , a clause which provides that a seller gives no undertaking that <the goods are fit> for any purpose and purports to exclude the implied term in s14(3) of the SGA 1979 , or a term which disclaims any duty of care in negligence , is subject to the Act .
 94882406:  For instance , the seller of goods might expressly exclude the statutory implied terms relating to the goods --- The Seller gives no undertaking that <the goods are fit> for any particular purpose .
 94919935:  Sections 13 , 14 and 15 of SGA 1979 include four major implied conditions which relate to conformity with description , and in a supply transaction in the course of a business <the goods are merchantable> and are fit for their purpose and conform to any sample provided .
 27060194:  If <the goods are faulty> but repairable , haggle for a further discount .
 73328862:  Thus where p = 1 , <the goods are perfect> substitutes , but where p < 1 , diversity is valued .
 28743855:  It is to include the date of removal of goods or of their arrival , a description of the goods sufficient to identify them , the value or consideration involved and , if <the goods are subject> to a process , then a description and value of the process .
 94315295:  Many businessmen suppose that there is a general obligation on the seller ( in the absence of exclusion clauses to the contrary ) to ensure that <the goods are fit> for the purpose for which the buyer intends to use them .
 71133218:  This is likely to be the case only where similar goods are unobtainable elsewhere , e.g. if <the goods are unique> or virtually so , as in Behnke v. Bede Shipping Co. ( 1927 K.B. ) .
 94931068:  However , s14(3) comes into its own where the purpose in question is not a common one , or even if it is a common one <the goods are fit> for some other common purpose thereby making them merchantable .
 60015844:  People buy goods and then find , for one reason or another <the goods are faulty> , or they 're unsatisfactory in some way and the customer then tries to get some kind of compensation .
 17907795:  In voluntary-aided schools , <the governors are responsible> .

 24636978:  <The greens are remarkable> by any standard .

 45883835:  The Schoenberg is played in a disappointingly literal fashion , and if all <the notes are present> a poor recording balance tends to obliterate important contrapuntal strands , particularly in the first piece .
 86077233:  <The notes are pertinent> to the exhibition , but left me slightly disquieted : the style of writing is , appropriately , neither fact not fiction , but this allows her to make shifts through sleights of words which in more academic circumstances would beg fuller exposition .
 26155027:  ( Infuriatingly , though , <the notes are due> to appear in a separate volume , which has still not been published , so it is impossible to tell whether the quotation comes from a letter , from conversation or from some unauthenticated report at second-hand . )

 12216305:  The faces of <the nudes are simpler> , less tormented than those of his portraits , but since his friends were intellectuals , artists and writers , intense , complex men and women , consumed by an inner reality , that is hardly surprising ; the girls who posed for his nudes were healthy young women , models , maids , waitresses , milkmaids revelling in their bodies and their sexuality .

105258574:  Certainly owing to curriculum changes and other factors <the numbers are small> .

 67905006:  It might be said that if <the police are aware> that the procession is likely to take place because it has occurred in the past , the `` triggering '' justification for requiring advance notice is satisfied , and the chief of police could require compliance by indicating to those who have organised such marches on previous occasions that he is prepared to use his powers under section 12 to ensure co-operation if necessary .
 99417538:  But <the police are worried> if it happens again and again , they 'll simply become jailers to offenders who think they 're getting off lightly .

 46002654:  And what 's more <the prices are right> .

 54589311:  If we do as the Russians want and hand over all these prisoners to them whether or not <the prisoners are willing> to go back to Russia , we are ... sending some of them to their death ; and although in war we can not , as you point out ... afford to be sentimental , I confess that I find the prospect somewhat revolting , and I should expect public opinion to reflect the same feeling ...
 99383139:  Some of <the prisoners are sad> , others are sinister .
 62772558:  Sentencing policies , as a result of law and order campaigns mean <the prisoners are younger> and more likely to be black .
102652322:  <The prisons are full> in any case , since Britain jails a greater proportion of its population than any other European nation .
 41481317:  Conditions of living in most of <the prisons are sub-human> ... .
 86460299:  <The privatisers are unimpressed> .
 50414192:  Of course , <the prizes are crucial> .
 23405521:  Shields and <the prizes are lush> as a crystal fishbowl .

100170714:  `` <The problems are wide-ranging> and cover the whole social and economic spectrum .
 43261920:  <The problems are formidable> and they interlock in ways that make them more difficult to tackle .
 15629624:  Step 4 If <the problems are different> for each side or the solutions each side wants do not coincide then the bargaining is likely to be one involving conflict , that is based on I win , you lose .
 12066504:  But if <the problems are acute> , and the parents feel they are unable to cope , foster or home arrangements can be organised .
 11355598:  Germans will argue that <the problems are different> since Germany is now democratic .

100172500:  `` <The problems are wide-ranging> and cover the whole social and economic spectrum .
 58051167:  For some , though , some of <the problems are evident> from the point of retirement , or even before , and for very old people , in their eighties and nineties , the chances of considerable dependency are clearly rather high .

 44843489:  The exercise of these powers is triggered by complaints or referrals on specific matters , and <the procedures are judicial> .
 39715916:  Comment : <The procedures are vague> and in practice delegated almost entirely to schools .

 29586933:  Again , the summons is lodged with the Sheriff Court but from here on <the proceedings are different> .

  6371118:  If the power is exercised , <the proceeds are applicable> in the same way as the proceeds of a sale ordered by the court , and the mortgagor will remain liable to pay any deficiency .
 35066377:  The current architecture will not easily allow this , because <the processes are separate> and serial .

 18685597:  If <the products are high> quality , customers who have been persuaded to buy them by the advertising campaign will continue to buy , and the increase in sales will be long-lasting .
104539224:  In such cases , buyers might be often quite indifferent as to where the order goes ( especially where there is no particular price advantage and <the products are similar> ) and quite often a telephone call can obtain an order .
 50412646:  <The products are good> enough to need little in the way of revamping and apart from the odd addition to the range or a change of packaging little of any interest happens to the product .
 88851693:  If , for example , a firm were to amend its sales budget half-way through a budget period the personnel responsible for production need to know this amended sales budget so they can plan and make provisions to ensure <the products are available> for sale .

 53512679:  Already , support for vertical programmes is waning , as <the programmes are unsustainable> without continued massive donor support ( SCF , op. cit . ) .
 86720613:  <The programmes are wide-ranging> and involve visiting and local professional musicians and students .
 19665098:  My only solid criticism of the book is that <the programs are typeset> , rather than --- as in Sinclair 's book --- being dumped directly from the computer to the ZX printer .
 93524808:  Now we know <the projects are economic> failures as well .
 53528206:  Several of <the projects are joint-funded> by the Overseas Development Administration .

 93071811:  However , the financial experts still advise that <the properties are saleable> .
 94110864:  However , assuming <the properties are significant> assets , a full investigation of title is to be preferred to either reliance upon a certificate from the vendor 's solicitors that the vendor has a good and marketable title ( since certificates of title are qualified and their benefit depends upon the status of the firm of solicitors providing them ) or reliance upon warranties and indemnities alone since the purchaser would rather have problems disclosed before the purchase than have to rely upon a right to sue under warranties which will be subject to general limitations .
 76985345:  For even when <the proportions are beautiful> and unusual , the view stupendous , the privacy assured , a window covering is still the most practical way of shutting out the depressing sight of rain , avoiding too much heat loss , preventing draughts in winter and the discomforts of too much sun in summer .

 32120487:  <The proportions are good> and we could make a separate flat for Nonni .

 93392377:  <The proposals are due> to be considered by the IAEA board in December .
 79298034:  <The proposals are significant> not for what they do but for what they omit .
 80251106:  And <the proposals are likely> to contain guidelines for teachers dealing with dyslexia and other reading problems in the classroom .
  2131493:  Almost 80 per cent of Tory voters say they are unlikely to change parties if the NHS plans go ahead , but 70 per cent believe <the proposals are likely> to lead to privatisation of the NHS , with 62 per cent seeing the changes leading to worse standards of care and treatment .

 80745717:  <The pros are meticulous> on these points , or at least the majority of them are , because others --- like them making their living --- are coming up behind .
 85688610:  Clearly , for the moment and for some years to come , <the prospects are slight> .

 12055593:  It has always been difficult for mentally handicapped people to find employment when they leave school , but now <the prospects are grim> indeed .
 46410302:  Education can be a route to a narrow range of professions , but for most <the prospects are poor> .
  1952614:  But if the market is still stagnant or even falling <the prospects are worrying> --- a higher debt and a lower property value .
  2486101:  In the long term , with bookings for next summer arriving in a bare trickle , <the prospects are disastrous> .
 62286803:  `` And <the prospects are good> because Littlewood 's are growing all the time .

 39222913:  If the handle and what you can see of the bud are still green , <the prospects are good> .
 39456382:  If we go only by the legislation and other portents , then the outlook is overcast at present and we are not sure how it will clear ; if commitment and current initiatives are anything to go by , then <the prospects are brighter> .

 38692070:  <The provisions are well-intentioned> hopes , for which arguments may be forthcoming , but with which many will disagree .
 94145910:  <The provisions are complex> and specialist advice should be sought .

 98534972:  Games are an integral part of any school 's curriculum and the same can be said for New College , but all <the pupils are blind> or have got very little sight .
 49492617:  This may be due to a lesser degree of familiarity with the larger units which are 1,000 times as large as the smaller units with which <the pupils are likely> to have more practical experience .
105738503:  If <the pupils are bored> the should make it interesting enough to keep their interest .
108749526:  Yeah its brilliant <the puppets are fantastic> in that .
 94439905:  The issues accountants have to decide are the same whether the vendors are entitled to their deferred consideration or <the purchasers are entitled> to repayment of part of the purchase price because of breach of warranty .
 62836779:  `` Well , we 'll think , '' said Caspar , `` See now , if the crimsons and <the purples are evil> --- ''
 80483815:  The conduct of the defenders and the effect of such conduct on the minds of <the pursuers are significant> factors from which it may be inferred that the defenders intended to repudiate the contract .
 67757552:  <The pygmies are hang-gliding> at us in swarms . ''
 20189153:  But <the qualifications are numerous> .
 50425076:  In dilute solutions of strong bases or acids , <the quantities are comparable> , but for weak bases or acids they are not .
 32571832:  Although <the quantities are different> , the source , fall-off curves and distribution of greywacké whetstones ( black dots ) and the neolithic axes are very similar , emphasising how the source of stone for the whetstones may have been glacial erratics .
 32565379:  The centres of highest consumption are some distance from Kent where <the quantities are small> .
 60540644:  The strong interactions between <the quarks are supposed> to be carried by spin-1 particles called gluons , rather like the particles that carry the weak interaction .
 47573138:  Now the bankers and boats have gone , and <the quarries are silent> as the trade moves west .
 23006931:  Each horse is , of course , different , and whether the shoulders or <the quarters are likely> to need adjusting depends on the individual .
 20157382:  It is not that <the questioners are unintelligent> , but rather that they are uninformed --- and , after all , as science writers information is our business .
  8735855:  <The questions are hard> because a recombinational event may have no effect on the fitness of the individual in which it occurs , but only on what other genes a particular gene will associate with in future generations .
 21026378:  <The questions are similar> in that both are a reflection of the values and morals of society at the time .
 96506078:  Clearly you do n't want to know all the syllabus so you 're gon na miss parts out but you 're better off knowing more topics in case some of <the questions are difficult> on the ones that you 've covered or they 're not on there at all When is the exam ?
 98382179:  <The questions are identical> I think .
  9373025:  All the television flummery --- lights , sets , graphics , music and the rest --- does n't matter a jot if <the questions are feeble> and the answers are , as in a cookery demonstration , clearly prepared earlier .

 91508948:  These must be addressed in such a way as to help pupils to see that <the questions are open> ones , worthy of their attention throughout life .
 62650898:  <The questions are clear> : what kinds of learning should primary schools seek to promote , and what are the most effective ways of achieving them ?
 74471056:  <The questions are concise> and well worded so as to avoid endless lists of fact gathering queries .
  1871726:  Although some of <the questions are dippy> , the volume is an inimitable record of poetic opinions and conversational habits .
 54195837:  <The questions are independent> of any evidence and we allowed them to be asked and argued .
111482078:  As long as you make the point , and and in the as long as <the quotes are grammatical> , and as long as you can understand it , the the simple thing about any kind of communication is that you should communicate you know rather than you 're not trying to win the Booker Prize , are you , so just as long as you get the information over do n't worry too much about the , the journalism .
  5911697:  <The rabbis are skilled> brinkmen .
 22611090:  But , of course , rabbits are a commercial as well as a sporting crop and on that basis most efforts at containing their numbers are carried out when the bulk of <the rabbits are likely> to be mature .
 22628529:  In those situations where the hole has been dug and the ferret and rabbit ( or rabbits ) have been located , you must be well drilled in the exact procedure to ensure that <the rabbits are unable> to take advantage of any opportunity you may give them to escape .
 22626320:  This causes a reaction even after they have been entangled for <the rabbits are inclined> to bite at the net if they are left within it for too long .
 61468833:  All the above codes and standards require the discharge of large quantities of water where <the racks are high> and the hazard rating of the goods is high also .

110521222:  <No raggers are fucking> crap .
 92216732:  I know <the rails are electric> , but the gap between them is a whole yard wide .
 14837740:  The heat is so intense that <the rails are likely> to buckle and passengers are expected to help repair the track .
 28488266:  Overall , however , <the railways are likely> to be one of the toughest state sell-offs of them all , for BR has not made a profit for 40 years and is widely perceived as demoralised and run-down .
 21035663:  Eurotunnel also signed a usage agreement with British Rail and SNCF under which <the railways are entitled> to use half the capacity of the Tunnel .

 75018891:  <The reactors are similar> in design to the Chernobyl plant but have undergone a number of modifications since 1986 .
 62492220:  <The reasons are clear> .
 86104741:  <The reasons are numerous> --- the recession , people 's awareness of drink/driving and perhaps a perception that in some way white spirits are healthier !

 79818546:  Some of <the reasons are temporary> , others are more long-lasting in their significance .
 45641706:  There is an important methodological point worth discussing here , for Freud points out that it is not possible simply to take what people themselves say are the reasons for the taboos they practise , for if <the reasons are unconscious> , they will not be able to do this .
 14823807:  <The reasons are numerous> and sometimes complex but curiosity about the planet on which we live is a prime motivator .
 37024571:  Some of <the reasons are religious> ; some literary ; some to do with his well-merited reputation as a blunt-talking character who , like Samuel Johnson , drew the wisdom of his conversation and letters from ancient sources , Christian or pagan , as much as modern --- a wisdom somehow as congenial to the sceptical as to the godly .
  5164324:  <The reasons are simple> : Quisling , a former army officer , diplomat , and minister of defence was the first of his kind ; and his bid for power , though his own idea , by coinciding with the German takeover was assumed to be part of it .
 38627182:  In part <the reasons are technical> ( the typewriter and camera --- and now the computer tape --- have made the keeping of records easier ) , but it is also a result of the increasing complexity of social organization .
 52944255:  Among <the reasons are greater> mobility before retirement , which enables them to acquaint themselves with alternative residential locations , and the financial advantages of moving from larger to smaller houses , perhaps in less expensive areas ( Law and Warnes 1976 ) .
 98504754:  But <the rebels are unrepentant> .
  5837590:  Farther north , in the Jaffna peninsula , where <the rebels are strong> , government aircraft have been bombing civilian areas .
100183047:  <The recipes are cheap> because they focus on increasing the amount and proportion of filling starchy carbohydrate foods which means you need less of the more expensive meat , fish , eggs and so on .
 62497973:  They raise little revenue because so many of <the recipients are poor> .
 42813082:  <The recollections are vivid> .
103384147:  Magnus Linklater , editor of The Scotsman , said : `` <The recommendations are expensive> , bureaucratic and in my view over-complicated .
102236837:  <The recommendations are similar> to comments from Roger Carr , former chairman of the Countryside Commission ( which has since merged with the Nature Conservancy Council to form SNH ) , and John Foster , ex-director of the commission .

 20813793:  Exposition repeats are observed in the outer movements of K550 , but not K551 , and <the recordings are sweet> , clean , and warm , with excellent clarity .
 30087192:  The case has already told you that <the records are incomplete> .
 31209300:  The rough timber , fencing , bamboo , reeds , thatch and so on used by farmers and primitive people may possibly amount to nearly as much again , but naturally , <no records are available> .
 14254425:  In artistic ways they do because <the records are successful> but I 'm tired of being broke , very tired of that , and it 's especially hurtful when you meet so many in the industry who do n't have quite your status but are laughably rich . ''
 14793110:  As J. D. North , who has drawn attention to these , remarks , `` Taken singly , <the records are easy> to view with scepticism , but taking them together , and noting especially that relatively large sums of money are involved in payment for the materials used , they persuade us that the mechanical clock had indeed arrived on the scene . ''
 90102046:  If <the records are good> , the live act 's better .
 70731580:  Making letter production and record maintenance into a single combined operation ensures that <the records are up-to-date> , because only by updating them can a letter be sent .
 34411009:  The fish is distinctive , with a cast to one eye , so <the records are precise> .
   699044:  `` But <the redcoats are good> hunters .
 27775807:  It is unfortunate that <the referees are upset> . ''
 20752520:  `` If <the references are OK> then there is not a lot you can do to stop things like this happening , '' he says .
 34920767:  Sure , <the references are obvious> .
 93313180:  Critics say that this means that <the reforms are unlikely> to be effective [ see ED 44 ] .
 53385270:  <The reforms are due> to become law in October 1992 .
 40810457:  Now that the UN provides food , <the refugees are bored> , listless and jobless .
 99018147:  <The refugees are sick> and weary .
 57357878:  The uneven terrain and distribution of population means that <the regions are unequal> in size : the Strathclyde Region covers nearly half of the whole population of Scotland .
 79258594:  It does not matter to the Labour party that <the regions are unpopular> , or that they can not be afforded , or that they are unwanted .
 62579713:  More characteristic of <the regions are small> graded rivers and streams fed by springs and surface runoff , and seasonal , short-lived torrents that flow from glaciers .
 90472287:  Normally , the ingenuity which requires protection is in the circuitry represented by the patterns formed by the conducting materials , but <the regulations are wider> in the sense that they will apply in situations where the ingenuity lies not so much in the horizontal patterns themselves but in the vertical arrangement of layers .
 16468224:  The adviser 's stress may be further compounded by the feeling that <the regulations are unfair> .
101481628:  His department has also been prevented from making an early start on council tax administration because <the regulations are incomplete> .
 99129066:  He says <the regulations are clear> .
101244029:  <The regulations are supposed> to tie him down to sailing no more than three miles out to sea and to stay within 15 miles of the harbour .
104435790:  In our example , <the relationships are linear> .
 89137143:  <The relationships are transitive> , i.e. a related module may have its own relationships which will also be preserved --- and so on to any depth , so that :
104435777:  <The relationships are direct> ones .
 54783474:  Because <the relationships are simple> , they will not considerably burden your memory , and at the same time will assist you in building up your intuitive picture .
 85949331:  There are slight variances in these generalities depending on whether <the relationships are binary> or n-ary and on the cardinality of the relationship ( Quang & Chartier-Kastier , 1991 , pp 103--107 and Elmasri & Navathe , 1989 , pp 329--334 give details ) .
 85949461:  The mapping of relationships also depends on whether <the relationships are binary> or n-ary and on the cardinality of the relationship .
 35478737:  The leaf-people are not linked to humans in such a direct way , but structurally <the relationships are analogous> .
  8084477:  If <the relatives are able> to go to the mortuary or viewing room and be with the person who has died for as long as they feel it to be necessary , then they are more able to start absorbing the fact of their loved one 's death , because again they have the evidence in front of them .
 88951806:  <The remains are extensive> and in good condition showing frescoes , mosaics and marbles .
 39218212:  Make a note of the symptoms , and pin it up in the garden shed --- <the remedies are self-evident> .
 54419035:  The restitutionary and compensatory provisions of section 5 do not in terms identify the person or persons against whom <the remedies are available> .
 70146558:  It 's small , that 's why it 's up here , where <the rents are low> .
 68133523:  The engine drivers are Chinese , and <the repairers are Chinese> .
 99723157:  <The repairs are likely> to cost at least 20 000 pounds ... though the Rector 's hoping the national attention his spire has attracted will help with raising the funds .
 50381682:  <The reporters are useful> contacts but they are often difficult to reach .
 94250187:  Too often , fundamental points are not raised until <the reports are complete> .
 74493067:  <The reports are available> in formats which have been approved by the Latter day Saints .
 32824848:  <The reports are analogous> with the popular British Regional Geology guides on land , and the first of the series to be published , The geology of the Moray Firth , has been well received .
 66595574:  `` <The reports are unequivocal> .
 75490174:  The agendas for the above 3 meetings will be issued in due course , but it is not intended that the reports should be circulated again ; spare copies of <the reports are available> for members , by telephoning me at the undernoted extension .
 28702065:  Scan the business pages of a national newspaper and <the reports are grim> : slashed investment , cutbacks in new plant and equipment , high debts , squeezed cash flow , the list goes on .
 87561267:  `` <The reports are bland> and could have been doctored . ''
 41093463:  <The repressors are coloured> gold , with the faces of their {GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA} -strands pale green , the DNA blue and the SAM molecules green .
 98601200:  None of <the reptiles are venomous> , although some of these boa constrictors could give a nasty squeeze .
 70381712:  If <the requirements are modest> er modest requirements with modest standards , it 's still a quality job if we achieve what we said we 're going to do .
 43548765:  Goods are issued and <the requisitions are used> to post the times used to the bin cards and stock record cards .
 19904875:  But <the researchers are optimistic> .
 79783938:  In particular <the researchers are interested> in responses to a recent directive concerning the uses and meanings of literacy practices in the writers ' lives .
 85555274:  `` <The reserves are fresh> , '' Woodruffe said .
 19347411:  Although <the reserves are vast> , this supply will also run out in the not-too-distant future .
 98819307:  She 's very caring and popular all <the residents are concerned> .
101464310:  In each unit there is a kitchen where <the residents are able> to make their own snacks and a communal television and activity room .
 33313181:  Although many homes may be managed by men , most of the low paid care assistants , and many of <the residents are likely> to be women .
 34043842:  Parish council clerk Alan Harrison said : `` If <the residents are unhappy> with the name , they can ask for it to be changed .
 20273446:  There are many housing schemes which provide small apartments or flats --- both `` single '' and `` double '' size --- under the care of a warden , who checks regularly that <the residents are safe> and well .
  2868201:  <The residents are able> to enjoy the privacy of their own accommodation together with the communal facilities offered within these projects .
 40346804:  They think they can get away with it because <the residents are new> to this country and do n't know their rights . ''
 96058376:  Many of <the residents are single> parents who often feel isolated and trapped and unable to improve their situation .
  2869921:  <The residents are able> to enjoy the privacy of their own accommodation , together with the communal facilites offered within these projects .
101826730:  Labour ward councillor Hannah Straiton said : `` <The residents are delighted> with the centre . ''
 16997664:  Figure 9.11 shows the stem and leaf display of the residuals from the repeat median and hanning smooth ( the 3RH for short ) ; it shows that <the residuals are small> in relation to the original data , fairly symmetrical , centred around zero and devoid of outliers .
 17005191:  The procedure is therefore iterated , and the final fit is converged upon slowly by repeating the process until <the residuals are patternless> --- a procedure known as polishing the fit .
 43144423:  Anomalies should therefore be checked by panning the soils to see if <the resistates are fresh> and angular ( eluvial ) or smooth and rounded ( alluvial ) .
 11205176:  At the beginning and end of the season when <the resorts are quieter> and more relaxed , we can offer special holidays at really rock-bottom prices .
 45062132:  <The resorts are elegant> and easy on the eye , the hotels are stylish and airy .
 10862821:  It 's not all frogs legs and strings of onions in the South of France --- <the resorts are glamorous> and the scenery beautiful .
 45680438:  <The resorts are outstanding> and the fly-drive arrangements allow complete flexibility .
 44085431:  <The resources are suitable> for use by pastors , mission workers , Christian educators and church school leaders .
 94994678:  Under that Rule , the party confirming that <the resources are available> will not be expected to produce the cash itself provided , in giving the confirmation , it acted responsibly and took all reasonable steps to assure itself that the cash was available .
 93838896:  I would just like to [unclear] whether in principle <the resources are irrespective> of .
 11290114:  This will be important where <the resources are vital> for the well being of a subject 's dependent young ( see also Cheney 1978 ; Wrangham 1977 ) .
 58809897:  Both the sample and <the responders are likely> to be biased in favour of those of higher social and educational status .
 53388378:  For other directions <the responses are intermediate> .
 53901701:  Nor are we concerned with ensuring that <the responses are voluntary> , since the whole purpose of section 2 is to ensure that they are not .
 68061793:  The processes include interactions amongst soil materials , water and gravity or the mobilization , translocation and redeposition of materials by water flow and mass movements , whilst <the responses are identifiable> physical and morphological properties of the soil and also of surface morphology .
 41703002:  `` <The responsibilities are identical> , '' wrote Haley .
   954293:  <The restorers are eager> to learn .
 73438764:  The intuition behind the test is once again that if <the restrictions are valid> we would expect the sum of square residuals , and hence their logarithms , to be approximately the same in both the restricted and the unrestricted models .
 73478597:  The two sets of estimates of and should , in large samples , be approximately the same , if <the restrictions are correct> .
 73438384:  Thus , to test the restrictions in our simple example we would estimate equations ( 3.19 ) and ( 3.20 ) separately and , from the sum of square residuals for each regression , compute the F-test statistic given above ; then , compare the result with the critical F value , given the appropriate degrees of freedom , and reject the hypothesis that <the restrictions are valid> if the computed F statistic is higher than the critical value from tables of the F distribution .
 73439254:  If <the restrictions are valid> we would expect the generalized variance from the restricted and unrestricted models to be approximately the same .
 73445484:  This feature occurs because rational expectations generally implies restrictions on the coefficients of the model , and if <the restrictions are valid> then imposing them should not worsen the model 's explanatory power .
 73445138:  The likelihood ratio test statistic for testing the null hypothesis that <the restrictions are correct> is 8.58 , which has to be compared with a chi-square variate with eight degrees of freedom .
 28028478:  <The results are clear> to see : divorce , child and wife abuse , alcoholism and drug addiction .
 73052306:  It may be argued that <the results are likely> to be sensitive to the assumptions of the model .
 43572396:  In the main <the results are consistent> with other researchers ( e.g. Hofstede ) and reinforce the conclusion that what is effective in one country may be ineffective in another .
 10013726:  The company said <the results are likely> to include an £8{1/2}m exceptional loss resulting from the appointment of administrative receivers to its client , Quietwater , with which it had a contract to build a hotel and leisure complex on a golf course development in Essex .
 99551312:  At one hospital staff have been taking extra steps to make sure patients know what choices they have , and they say <the results are dramatic> .
 20181871:  <The results are dramatic> --- but how does the body become deficient in vitamin E , what is its role in human nutrition and why does its absence sabotage the nervous system ?
 53567312:  On its own , replication does not validate a theory derived from experimental results ; it merely shows that <the results are obtainable> .
 53563336:  It simply does not follow that because the legal forms have been observed , the results are more reliable ; any more than it follows that whenever the forms are breached , <the results are unreliable> .
 54684257:  Attempts have been made to determine whether there is a correlation between manual preference and eye dominance , but to date <the results are conflicting> .
 54712436:  <The results are conflicting> .
 40625500:  <The results are dramatic> : the share of world output produced by the rich industrial economies drops to 54% , from 73% on the old method .
 77565147:  Despite millions of dollars being pumped into the area over ten years , <the results are disappointing> .
 55994759:  Herman refers to 14 such studies , but notes that <the results are inconsistent> , with nine of them finding that owner-controlled companies performed better than those subject to management control .

 35767338:  The typhoon shelters at Aberdeen and Mong Kok start to fill with craft , their prudent masters and owners looking uneasily at the eastern sky as it blackens and darkens , and as the wind begins to sing in the telephone wires , the unsecured edges of roofs begin to flap and creak , and <the streets are busy> with flying litter , and dust .

 73435413:  First , when the questions asked in <the surveys are qualitative> in nature ( for example : Do you expect the inflation rate to rise , fall , stay the same ? ) , any quantitative index we use to measure the response is likely to be a crude indicator of the magnitude of the true underlying expectation and is likely to contain measurement errors .

 53792524:  As you probably know , they lay their eggs in strings , not clumps , and <the tadpoles are toxic> to fish : therefore , in a garden pond , there is a higher survival rate than with frogs .
 73577284:  Those near the centre of the distribution are long and relatively narrow whereas those towards <the tails are low> and proportionately broader ( Fig. 3.7 ) .
 64096631:  It is hard to verify whether or not this is the dreadful fish it is made out to be or whether <the tales are apocryphal> , but what is certain is that the species itself does exist .
  5804393:  <The talks are retrievable> .
 78536764:  Will the right hon. Gentleman bluntly refute the despicable accusation that those taking part in <the talks are responsible> for the deaths of innocent people at the hands of the IRA ?

105430198:  <The tapes are available> at £6.75 each or £12.50 for both inclusive of p/p .
 98933340:  Pop fans are being warned <the tapes are poor> quality and not worth their twelve pound price tag .
 50330526:  However , it is obviously important that <the targets are relevant> ( e.g. based upon international comparisons ) , that reasonable detail on the outcomes is available , and most importantly that clearly defined action is taken to improve poor performance .

  3919505:  In the first case the task is easier if <the targets are larger> , are closer to each other and more regularly arranged .

 61927273:  The course assumes that <the teachers are qualified> teachers of at least one foreign language ( probably English ) in their own country , that they are native speakers of the language they are going to teach in Britain , and that they have a good practical command of English .

 70291036:  It is true that , at a certain level , novelists and social anthropologists are engaged in the same kind of enterprise , but <the techniques are different> and , in general , they should not be mixed up .
 77674156:  Although many of <the techniques are similar> to those needed for cold and hot water plumbing , the consequences of making a mistake are potentially much more serious and if you are found out , you could be heavily fined .

 77345117:  The days are relentlessly hot and long , and <the temporeros are hungry> most of the time .
 31938950:  My memories of <the tenants are hazy> and episodic .

 17451141:  Using CFCs in refrigeration units does n't become a problem ( apart from the leakage from breakdown or badly-maintained units ) until <the units are redundant> .
 69841204:  <The units are expendable> and can easily be replaced so long as the tree is healthy .
 69825001:  <The units are small> enough to fill up the space almost as a liquid would fill it .
 75257766:  Aimed primarily at self-service outlets , <the units are available> in three sizes --- 1200 , 1500 and 1800 mm in length --- with each unit comprising a display area of three glass shelves and a display well which are chilled by recirculating blown air .
 69841242:  This seems a paradox but it is not : the system is geared to the needs of the operating units but <the units are expendable> so long as the system remains intact .
 86025341:  But the plan has hit serious problems because <the universities are unwilling> to offer the scientists contracts .
 78005261:  Then , turning towards the kitchen , she said , `` We 'd better make sure <the urns are full> of water . ''
 85967950:  <The urns are pretend> poppy pods ...
 19419885:  Disadvantage : the chute can become fouled and therefore should only be built if <the users are willing> to keep it clean .
111650655:  As far as <the users are concerned> , it is a diversion of an extra ten miles on their journey .
 58851057:  A further cause for concern is that ketamine can sometimes result in a state where <the users are unconcerned> whether they live or die .
 90227626:  At this stage , the designer works closely with the services engineers to ensure that <the utilities are sufficient> and necessary for the equipment .
 41582411:  ( Of course , <no utterances are safe> from the post-Freudian trick of claiming that they mean the opposite of what they say , but in the interpretation of literary texts we must be given additional , fairly unequivocal evidence of a discrepancy between speech and meaning , as we are given for Iago , but not for Othello . )
 73022306:  According to our preferred model only two-thirds of <the vacancies are acceptable> to teenage men .
 11209723:  <The valleys are absolute> tranquillity and it is no wonder that writers and poets have found inspiration here for many years .

 12551266:  Twain is quoted as recording that `` one may ride ten miles , hereabouts , and not see ten human beings '' and that `` the hills are barren ... <the valleys are unsightly> deserts ... it is a hopeless , dreary , heartbroken land ...
 24835588:  Use the clean channel but remove the fan cooling the output valves ( it already makes a rattling noise ! ) so that <the valves are hotter> and `` clip '' at lower volumes .
 73583604:  All these operations should be carried out in a fume cupboard as <the vapours are harmful> , and surgical gloves should be used to protect the hands from the dye .
 88850981:  * The projections for next year assume certainty ; in reality all <the variables are uncertain> .
 17028624:  General causal models can not be drawn up when interactions exist between the variables ; the only solution is to draw up a separate causal model for each of the groups for whom the effects of <the variables are different> .

  5669265:  Bring the soup to the boil , stirring from time to time , then simmer slowly for 45--60min , until <the vegetables are soft> and the lentils have cooked and thickened the soup .
 69530121:  Add the mushrooms and courgette and fry over a medium heat for 8 minutes or until <the vegetables are soft> .
 60768508:  There are no flowers in our garden , but <the vegetables are exceptional> .

 11758455:  The light output is quite sufficient for the speeds <the vehicles are capable> of .
 30762021:  `` without the engine being stopped '' Means that apart from the exceptions at regulation 107(2) ( a ) and ( b ) ( the main ones are shown at 4 ante ) , the engines of all motor vehicles must be stopped when <the vehicles are unattended> .
 72157219:  If <the velocities are small> .
 94281263:  However , <the vendors are likely> to resist giving extensive warranties since it is the managers , not they , who have been involved in the day-to-day running of the company .
 94439896:  The issues accountants have to decide are the same whether <the vendors are entitled> to their deferred consideration or the purchasers are entitled to repayment of part of the purchase price because of breach of warranty .

 59965751:  But the , <the vibes are bad> .
 59965761:  <The vibes are bad>

  2271973:  Lord Flowers , vice-chancellor of London University , says <the vice-chancellers are prepared> to discuss funding mechanisms with the Government , but must make the point that they will not accept under-funding of the universities .
 45979222:  South Central LA is one of America 's civil war zones , a suburban ghetto torn apart by drugs , where the murder rate is at an all time high and almost all <the victims are black> .
 41802051:  This is probably a function of a higher proportion of guilty pleas being put forward when <the victims are younger> : something akin to plea bargaining is almost certainly taking place .
  5534793:  <The victims are unlikely> to believe that they can do much from their own resources if action is dependent on billions of dollars , and the developed nations can hardly man every environmental barricade from Ethiopia to the Amazonian rainforest .
100754357:  All <the victims are professional> men and three , possibly four , were known homosexuals .
 20216060:  Measles often kills in Africa , particularly when <the victims are young> and undernourished .
 19626179:  It is especially disturbing when <the victims are young> people who have never worked .
 33256960:  But even short of this , other critics believe <the videos are likely> to foster some beneficial change .
 24850811:  <The videos are available> through IMP and retail at around £30 each .
 15504321:  If you take something like The Hit Man and Her , presumably a lot of the viewers are in fact women , or more specifically young women , because they are the ones who buy Smash Hits , they are the ones who watch Top of the Pops ; yet the presenter , Pete Waterman , implicitly assumes that <the viewers are male> --- he greeted the audience at the beginning of one programme with `` Cor , boys , have we got a load of crumpet here tonight ! ''
 45081533:  Nestled on a mountain terrace nearly 1,000 feet above the azure sea , from here <the views are magnificent> and a cablecar links you to Taormina Beach below .

 35914146:  <The views are magnificent> : of extensive sheets of water backed by imposing heights , Cul Beag and Cul Mor filling the eastern sky and the sprawling mass of Ben More Coigach across a deep trench to the south , every prospect enhanced by the spectacular array of pinnacles in the foreground , subjects for a score of camera studies .
 63725189:  You can stand here and look at all these trees which come from all over the world , and we 're open all year round and there 's always something to see , and <the views are spectacular> .

 45108149:  <The views are exceptional> and the hotel 's 120 acres of garden and vineyard enhance the setting .
 10872422:  The apartments are set against a mountain backdrop and <the views are superb> ; it 's hard to believe that the discos , lively bars and general hustle of Benitses are only a five to ten minute walk away .
 36011595:  <The views are outstanding> .
 84342374:  on the value of intelligence tests or of the reliability of certain statistical devices used in these examinations , there is no reason why he should not give his views , bur he will no doubt make it clear how far <the views are personal> to himself .
 35121334:  It 's easy to walk along and <the views are unparalleled> .
 11220831:  Either up the mountains or around the lakes , <the views are superb> .
 11225844:  Wherever you go , <the views are marvellous> and the grandeur of the mountains breathtaking .
  2763639:  <The views are stunning> , looking to the sea over the Kyle of Tongue , to Ben Hope dominating the west and the wilderness of North Sutherland stretching away almost infinitely to the south .
 64000707:  <The villagers are great> , and with full support from the local authorities both communities have thrown themselves into planning the social side of it .

 23802445:  Most of <the vines are east-facing> and located to the north of the village , with the best sites found at heights between 140 and 220 metres .
 77805323:  <The vines are greedy> --- hardy , and they push deep roots down into the soil , but they are also vulnerable .
 38374127:  There is a lot of talk but <the voices are calm> .
 67654061:  Strictly speaking , counterpoint or polyphony means music in a number of parts , where <the voices are independent> but combine to form a coherent whole .
 98529097:  <The voices are familiar> , so are the characters .
 95562217:  there is an issue and clearly if we are not in the sixteen double O four six eight O seven business we are going to lose share , we may not lose total volume , I am confused about that , but do n't try and sort it out now , but those are the issues that need to be tackled , and you need to produce between you some sort of projection paper which lays out the way that you see this bit of the steering business going in the future , and recommends what we should be doing , and what the volumes are to support that , and what <the volumes are likely> to be .
 88911627:  Here , <the volutes are larger> as in the Ionic order and the upper row of acanthus leaves is replaced by the egg and tongue and bead and reel mouldings from the Ionic capital .
 27166805:  <The voters are entitled> to have their say on Maastricht and should be given it .
 49673986:  Nor is there any question of his being elected thanks to a miscellaneous accumulation of votes of lower than first preference : all <the votes are clear-cut> votes of first and only preference .

  9189588:  Mr Major and his managers believe that <the walkabouts are good> value .

 64114012:  Some of <the walks are suitable> for people with disabilities .
 60781325:  <The walls are black> and slimy with lichen and pigeon shit .
  7966640:  An electric imitation coal fire glows in the fireplace , <the walls are dark> panelled , the wallpaper plush , the ceilings arched and gothic .
   697380:  <The walls are straight> enough .
 37888888:  Around most of <the walls are black> stone excrescences which take the form of a rib-cage projecting from a central spine which grows up the north side of the room and arches up to the centre of the ceiling .
 36319904:  The branches that form <the walls are light> and springy but they are backed by stout tree trunks .
 73107054:  <The walls are sheer> and any intruder would eventually be noticed , as he would if he came through the gate .
 85239152:  Inside <the walls are narrow> Medieval streets , shops , houses , the castle and the cathedral of S. Nazaire .
 61316555:  Now <the walls are white> and the floors sealed .
 88919084:  <The walls are thick> and have arches with radiating voussoirs in brick ( 140 ) .
 32995056:  For the most part <the walls are steep> and blank , formerly quarried in places , and split by non-too-friendly cracklines .
 88936380:  <The walls are plain> and there are small windows at clerestory level and in the aisles .
 13449826:  <The wards are smaller> than the design brief suggested , but family/interview spaces are provided elsewhere in the hospice .
 37454263:  For this reason , most weights of watercolour paper are dampened and stretched before painting --- so the surface can remain flat until <the washes are dry> .
 99264581:  <The wasps are enterprising> characters .
 62582347:  <The waters are clear> , and salinity and nutrient levels are very low ( Table 4.2 ) .
  7110501:  We have been told nothing about the time of year , but for the purposes of the story we must assume that the rains have come , and <the waters are high> and fast , even though the women and children have got across safely enough .
 56638009:  There is a lake down there , a big lake ; <the waters are black> and cold .
 49730542:  <The waves are transverse> , which means that the direction of oscillation has to be perpendicular to the direction of motion of the wave .
 67136439:  Where <the waves are unbroken> , i.e. outside the bar , the predominant movement of sand grains on the sea floor is towards the land , while , where a series of broken waves or surf occurs , the movement is mainly seawards .
  6087808:  <The weapons are expensive> partly because they are made of expensive components , but also because they are time-consuming to develop .
 20060964:  They are negotiating with Canada to allow them to do it there , but it has not happened yet and <the weapons are due> here in six months time .
 32563061:  <The weights are custom-made> or ground down Roman coins ; one or two appear to be actual Byzantine weights , or imitations , indicating the extent of exchange networks in the later sixth and seventh centuries in Europe .
 32563104:  Where accurate values for <the weights are available> , or the weights can be reweighed , they suggest that at least one unit was in use , particularly in Kent , based on c .
  7559910:  You see , <the weights are uneven> , '' he says .
 59564944:  On the ice-worn shores of the Bay of Fundy , it is evident that <the whelks are absent> from flat open rock surfaces .
 21797490:  When <the whites are firm> and stand in peaks , whisk in I tablespoon of the caster sugar for I minute .
  6420442:  In Barbados ( and other places such as Jamaica and Antigua ) , <the wickets are fast> and so the bowlers have traditionally bowled fast , while the batsmen have looked to attack at every opportunity , to hit the ball as hard and as gleefully as possible .
 70984202:  As an example consider a hybrid stepping motor in which the peak static torque produced by each phase is proportional to the phase current and the phase torques vary sinusoidally with rotor position : For conventional operation <the windings are excited> by positive and negative rated current , giving a step length of r/2p for each excitation change .
 70984279:  Therefore the rotor can be made to take up any intermediate position between the full-step positions if <the windings are excited> by currents in the correct proportion .
 18605993:  The hangings of <the windows are light> elegant draperies of blue and white satin , tastefully finished with fringe .
 88927313:  <The windows are small> and the vital characteristic is the mosaic covering to all interior surfaces .
 12167676:  Is there a check that <the windows are open> and air freshener blocks in place ?
 54809758:  Therefore we can say the " sides of <the windows are perpendicular> to the tops and bottoms of the windows " .
106726098:  <The windows are filthy> outside [unclear] .
 12840043:  <The windows are interesting> , with their association with the wool trade , though there is some speculation that some of them may have been brought from another house .
 10397306:  <The windows are open> , but the house is empty .
 56138028:  <The windows are open> to the night , spilling the sound of the pretenders ' first album out over the slope of grass towards the small loch and the lights of the library and Admin buildings on the far side .
 77139029:  <The windows are open> , with layer upon layer of sound coming out of the forest .
 85238600:  These show the basic French Gothic characteristics of verticality , abutment and good proportion , but the flying buttresses are more slender and more decorated than before , <the windows are larger> with complex curvilinear tracery in the head , ogee arches and mouldings are found on all members .
 99415721:  <The windows are solid> .
 63416216:  Windsurf intermediates or novices will enjoy themselves immensely if they 're to stick to the sheltered area when <the winds are stronger> .
 63412596:  We do n't provide formal dinghy instruction , but novices pick up a lot just by sailing out and back when <the winds are light> .
 67142324:  When <the winds are southerly> the drift would be in the reverse direction , but the waves responsible , being of smaller size due to limited fetch and generally lighter winds , would be capable of moving only the finer material back towards West Bay .
 35178651:  However , if <the winds are strong> it is better left till last until the flysheet is pegged out .
 63424833:  In April and after mid-October <the winds are unpredictable> and sometimes dangerously strong .
 32303090:  March is often a windy month and because <the winds are unsteady> at this time of year there is always a chance of very changeable weather from day to day .
 63404438:  It 's sometimes limited if <the winds are strong> and we have only a few experienced sailors on holiday .
 63401590:  Sail together into the gulf of Gököva , meeting at Körmen , perhaps with a midday stop at Mersinçik if <the winds are kind> .
 51325633:  Then a woman in the street --- the Via Monserato , between the Tiber and the Farnese Square , they talked about it so much , Mena and my grandmother , when I was little , I think they talked about it every day : Il Quartiere Papale , it does have a magnificent sound , has n't it ? and so much of it a slum ; the rich live above on the piani nobili , the ground floors and cellars are rented out to artisans ; my mother , who was brought up in those streets , says to know them you must have breathed the air in the evenings when <the wine-shops are full> and they are lighting charcoal braziers on the pavements ; she says I will go one day , but I think I know already --- well , a woman in Mena 's street who sold salad greens knew the cook who worked for Anna and the prince round the corner and Mena was given things to do in the kitchen .
 22751722:  Since then , this style has been questioned , and earlier picking of grapes and more judicious use of oak ageing means <the wines are capable> of being confused with the great French Chardonnays , such as Chablis , which have always been more restrained and elegant .
 20888610:  However , adventurous producers like Codorníu and Raimat are planting Chardonnay with considerable success , for <the wines are rich> and leafy with ripe flavours .
   487219:  Special care is needed if <the wings are wet> when extra speed is necessary , because the stalling speed is raised .
102965930:  And waiting in <the wings are bottom-placed> Dundee who , depending on the above results , may not have to play their outstanding fixture with Boroughmuir .
 49530569:  Detailed accounts of the development of <the wings are available> for the Exopterygote Pteronarcys ( Holdsworth , 1940 ; 1942 ) and for several Endopterygotes ( Kohler , 1932 ; Behrends , 1935 ; Hundertmark , 1935 ; Kuntze , 1935 ; Waddington , 1941 ; see also Clever , 1959 ) .
 96892421:  For example , in Canada where <the winters are severe> , most Trichostrongyloid larvae ingested in late autumn or winter become arrested , whereas in southern Britain with moderate winters , about 50-60% are arrested .
 20603082:  <The winters are long> and very cold , with temperatures ranging between -16°C and -48°C from October to March .
 12628273:  In regions with marked wet and dry seasons , or where rainfall is evenly distributed , but <the winters are cool> and there is a distinct growing season , the behaviour of the unsaturated zone becomes very important .
 11498543:  Where <the winters are cold> , the broadleaves contrive to save water in winter , and reduce wind and frost damage , by being deciduous and shedding winter leaves , while conifer leaves tend to have thick cuticles , to be needle-like in form , and are able to withstand the winters .
 11498495:  Where <the winters are warm> , both the broadleaves and the conifers tend to keep their leaves in winter , as with the evergreen oaks and cypresses of the Mediterranean ( though the swamp cypress of Florida is unusual among conifers , in shedding its leaves ) .
 17308574:  But here <the winters are colder> and more hay and fodder are needed .
 73572155:  Between <the wires are square> openings , the numbers of which per unit length give the mesh number and the diagonal the nominal size .
 54806668:  Since <the wires are stationary> only the disc contributes to the e.m.f. , hence the integration over the closed path reduces to integration along the radius of the disc , yielding .
 46551628:  So long as <the witnesses are willing> to attend to give evidence the examination may be completed and the result returned to the foreign court without the intervention of the court in England .
 47775760:  The evidence is plain , <the witnesses are persuasive> .
 32204395:  Gay oppression is class oppression : the people ca n't be free until <the women are free> .
 48610288:  <The women are terrified> , Carol biting her nails , Irene panicking about a ghost .
 52003633:  Anyway , the speaker added , with a grin , <the women are willing> cooperators , for they `` can not understand why their visitors expect to pay for sex '' .
 77475929:  <The women are glad> not to have to labour in their sweltering , smoke-filled little pole-and-dagga houses .
103674781:  <The women are unrepentant> .
 48612906:  And <the women are poor> because they are working-class and women .
 48584023:  <The women are single> parents : they are easy quarry .
 48599433:  And I like the job , <the women are great> and I believe in what we 're fighting for .
  1669991:  Most of <the women are primary> school teachers with responsibility for sports lessons , anxious to give all their budding Andy Gregorys the best possible advice .
 88301586:  <The women are fair> and just , the men dishonest and immoral !
 69501182:  So how do you find er arrangements things do , do you think <the women are satisfied> with the kind of provisions that there are made for them , the like of maternity leave and pay and things like that , health and safety ?
 69497481:  the d the , <the women are redundant> as it were .
 88302186:  These two examples perhaps show that Jessica , and once again , <the women are dishonest> .
 77578713:  <The women are overjoyed> .
 99904064:  This is blue-sky country where they play their music in that western way , <the women are sultry> , the men drawl from beneath crew-cuts --- and shocking things go on behind the blinds and the white picket fences .
 25514706:  <The women are lonely> because they are professional women and they have no sustenance .
 75347267:  Because a great many of <the women are illiterate> , music and drama are the best way of making an impact .
 35153897:  Other animals you might spot in <the woodlands are red> squirrels and roe deer .
 59733590:  in the small hours and for her <the woods are rapt> with whispering .
110553774:  I had some really good erm this too , listen to this , <the woods are lovely> dark and deep but I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep and miles to go before I sleep .
110553813:  <The woods are lovely> dark and deep but I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep and miles to go before I sleep by Robert Frost , Robert Frost .
 30872040:  even <the words are hypnotic> to you and me
 34872503:  `` Up '' ( and I think we 're talking more than the one level of ambiguity in that solitary two-letter word ) is a record that actually makes you feel happy , in that all of it is uplifting ( oi ! spiritually , not trouserly ) , you can dance to some of it and sing along to the rest , <the words are rude> and witty and always smart , and Richard Fairbrass is a fantastic pop singer , all post-Bowie and Ferry and languid , a sort of brightly-coloured Neil Tennant .
 18538271:  <The words are inadequate> : consilium makes it plain enough what the testator 's own wishes would be , but there is no trust unless he has made his intention that a legal obligation should arise equally clear .
 64798072:  Not all <the words are suitable> , so do not feel that you must use all of them .
 60480881:  I 'm still there , in their bed , and I like it ; but the oozy ecstasy belongs to Odilo , that glistening lizard , and to Herta , that glistening lizardess , in their world of succulent slime , where <no words are necessary> : you just croak and hum ...
 29439798:  It is then possible to ask how different combinations of <the words are possible> , such as :
 28066190:  <The words are gentle> , the lines of the drawing cruelly incisive .
111888523:  `` <The words are simple> , the acting brutal , bruising , physical , the direction tense '' .
 90517999:  <The words are difficult> to interpret .
 60251878:  Yes <the words are important> to people 's understanding are n't they ?
